The package is available on the Swift Package Index and is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. </p>\n<p>The generator is designed to work with OpenAPI specifications in JSON or YAML format. It uses the Swagger Codegen tool to generate Swift code from the specification. The generated code includes models, API clients, and server stubs. </p>\n<p>Developers can use the Swift OpenAPI Generator to quickly generate client and server code for their APIs. The generated code includes strongly typed models and API clients that make it easy to interact with the API. </p>\n<p>To use the generator, developers need to add it as a dependency in their Swift Package Manager manifest file. They can then use the <code>swift openapi generate</code> command to generate code from their OpenAPI specification. </p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use the generator to generate a client for an API:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">import OpenAPIGenerator\n\nlet generator = OpenAPIGenerator()\nlet specURL = URL(string: &quot;https://example.com/api/spec.json&quot;)!\nlet outputDirectory = URL(fileURLWithPath: &quot;/path/to/output&quot;)\n\ntry generator.generateClient(from: specURL, to: outputDirectory)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Swift OpenAPI Generator is a useful tool for developers who want to quickly generate client and server code for their APIs. It supports the latest OpenAPI specification and generates strongly typed code that is easy to use.</p>\n"}
