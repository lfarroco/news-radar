{"layout":"article.njk","title":"Dynamically Modifying db_table of a Django Model","date":"2023-06-22T03:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2023-6-22","source_link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/django/comments/14gf2b0/dynamically_modifying_db_table_of_a_model/","tags":["django"],"topics":[{"name":"Django","slug":"django"}],"content":"<p>A Reddit user is asking for help with dynamically updating the db_table meta property of a Django model. The user&#39;s first attempt resulted in a Programming Error exception when using querysets with the dynamically updated model. The issue seems to be that the original db_table name is cached somewhere, and it is used when generating the column names for the SQL query. Strangely, the query often contains both column names that use the old and the new db_table. </p>\n<p>While there are posts about dynamically creating models from scratch, the user couldn&#39;t find anything that maps to their specific use case. </p>\n<p>For developers working with Django, this is an important reminder of the potential pitfalls of dynamically updating model properties. It&#39;s crucial to understand how Django handles caching and SQL queries when making changes to a model&#39;s db_table. </p>\n<p>One possible solution to this problem is to create a new model with the desired db_table name and copy over the data from the old model. Another option is to use Django&#39;s built-in support for multiple databases to create a new database with the desired db_table name and migrate the data over. </p>\n<p>Overall, this issue highlights the importance of careful planning and testing when making changes to a Django model&#39;s properties. Developers should be aware of the potential consequences and take steps to mitigate any issues that may arise.</p>\n"}
