However, if not used properly, it can lead to security vulnerabilities in your web application. </p>\n<p>In a recent article, the author explains the risks associated with using <code>innerHTML</code> and provides code samples to demonstrate how it can be misused. The article also offers an alternative function, <code>setHTML(&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;)</code>, which is currently in an experimental state and may not be supported by all browsers.</p>\n<p>Developers should be aware of the potential risks when using <code>innerHTML</code> and ensure that it is used correctly to avoid security vulnerabilities. It is important to sanitize any user input before using it with <code>innerHTML</code> to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. </p>\n<p>Here is an example of how to properly sanitize user input before using <code>innerHTML</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const userInput = document.getElementById(&#39;userInput&#39;).value;\nconst sanitizedInput = userInput.replace(/&lt;/g, &#39;&amp;lt;&#39;).replace(/&gt;/g, &#39;&amp;gt;&#39;);\ndocument.getElementById(&#39;output&#39;).innerHTML = sanitizedInput;\n</code></pre>\n<p>By following best practices and properly sanitizing user input, developers can safely use <code>innerHTML</code> to manipulate HTML content in their web applications.</p>\n"}
