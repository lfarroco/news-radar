It is an open-source project developed by aeon-toolkit and is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license. Aeon provides a simple and intuitive interface for working with time series data, making it easier for developers to build machine learning models for time series analysis.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of Aeon is its ability to handle both univariate and multivariate time series data. It also provides a variety of tools for preprocessing, visualization, and analysis of time series data. Aeon&#39;s modular architecture allows developers to easily extend and customize the framework to fit their specific needs.</p>\n<p>Aeon supports a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models such as LSTM and GRU. It also provides a number of evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of machine learning models on time series data.</p>\n<p>To get started with Aeon, developers can install it using pip and then import it into their Python code. Here&#39;s an example of how to use Aeon for time series forecasting:</p>\n<pre><code>from aeon import TimeSeries\nfrom aeon.models import LSTM\n\n# Load time series data\ndata = TimeSeries.load_csv(&#39;data.csv&#39;)\n\n# Split data into training and test sets\ntrain_data, test_data = data.split_train_test(0.8)\n\n# Train LSTM model\nmodel = LSTM()\nmodel.fit(train_data)\n\n# Make predictions on test data\npredictions = model.predict(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate model performance\nmse = model.evaluate(test_data)\nprint(&#39;Mean Squared Error:&#39;, mse)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overall, Aeon is a powerful and flexible framework for machine learning with time series data. Its user-friendly interface and extensive documentation make it a great choice for developers looking to build machine learning models for time series analysis.</p>\n"}
