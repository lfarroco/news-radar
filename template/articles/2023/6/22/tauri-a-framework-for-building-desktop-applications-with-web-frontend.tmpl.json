It is designed to create smaller, faster, and more secure desktop applications. Tauri achieves this by leveraging web technologies and Rust&#39;s memory safety.</p>\n<p>Tauri provides a bridge between Rust and JavaScript, allowing developers to use JavaScript libraries in their Rust code. It also provides a way to package the application as a single executable, making it easy to distribute and install.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of Tauri is its security model. It uses a sandboxed approach to isolate the application from the host system, preventing it from accessing sensitive data or resources. This makes Tauri a great choice for applications that require high security, such as financial or healthcare applications.</p>\n<p>Tauri is also highly customizable, allowing developers to create their own plugins and extend the framework&#39;s functionality. It provides a set of APIs for interacting with the system, such as accessing files or interacting with the clipboard.</p>\n<p>To get started with Tauri, developers can use the CLI tool to create a new project. The tool generates a basic project structure, including a Rust backend and a web frontend. Developers can then customize the project to fit their needs.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to create a new Tauri project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cargo install tauri-bundler --force\n$ cargo install tauri-cli --force\n$ tauri init\n</code></pre>\n<p>In conclusion, Tauri is a powerful framework for building desktop applications with a web frontend. Its security model, customizability, and ease of use make it a great choice for developers who want to create fast, secure, and modern desktop applications.</p>\n"}
