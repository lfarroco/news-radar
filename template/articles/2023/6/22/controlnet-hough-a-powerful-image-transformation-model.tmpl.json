Developed by jagilley, a prominent figure in the AI modeling world, this model uses M-LSD line detection to modify images and create unique, altered versions of your images.</p>\n<p>ControlNet-Hough is an Image-to-Image model, meaning it takes an image as an input and spits out another image as an output. It&#39;s currently ranked 11th on AIModels.fyi, and has been run over 4,374,465 times, demonstrating its efficiency and popularity.</p>\n<p>The processing cost for each run is $0.0161 USD, and the average completion time is just 7 seconds, thanks to the Nvidia A100 (40GB) GPU it uses. </p>\n<p>In this beginner&#39;s guide, we&#39;ll walk you through the ControlNet-Hough model and show you how to use it to transform your images. We&#39;ll also explore how you can use AIModels.fyi to find similar models and decide which one you like.</p>\n<p>To get started, you&#39;ll need to install the necessary libraries and dependencies. Here&#39;s an example of how to install them using pip:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have the necessary libraries installed, you can load the ControlNet-Hough model and start transforming your images. Here&#39;s an example of how to use the model to transform an image:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import torch\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nmodel = torch.hub.load(&#39;pytorch/vision&#39;, &#39;pix2pix&#39;, pretrained=True)\n\ninput_image = Image.open(&quot;input_image.jpg&quot;)\npreprocess = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(256), transforms.ToTensor(),])\ninput_tensor = preprocess(input_image)\ninput_batch = input_tensor.unsqueeze(0)\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    output = model(input_batch)[&#39;out&#39;][0]\noutput_image = transforms.ToPILImage()(output)\noutput_image.save(&quot;output_image.jpg&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>With ControlNet-Hough, you can easily and effectively transform your images. Give it a try and see what unique creations you can come up with!</p>\n"}
