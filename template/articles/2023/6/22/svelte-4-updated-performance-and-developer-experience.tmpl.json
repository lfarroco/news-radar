Svelte 3 was released more than four years ago, and Svelte 4 takes advantage of the improvements in Node.js and browser APIs that have happened since then. This release is mainly a maintenance release, bumping minimum version requirements and tightening up the design in specific areas. It sets the stage for the next generation of Svelte to be released as Svelte 5.</p>\n<p>Svelte is a powerful language that allows developers to easily put together web UIs leveraging the power of HTML, CSS, JS, and the Svelte compiler. Svelte 4 comes with updated performance and developer experience. The release results in smaller and faster hydration code. SvelteKit users can see their compiled output shrink in size by examining the <code>.svelte-kit/output/client/_app/immutable/nodes</code> folder. For example, on kit.svelte.dev, the JS generated across the whole site was reduced in size by 12.7% (126.3 kB to 110.2 kB).</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re new to Svelte, you can take it for a spin in the interactive tutorial, on StackBlitz, or locally with <code>npm create svelte@latest</code>. Svelte 4 is a great choice for developers who want to keep up with the latest news in the industry. Watch Svelte Radio Live to learn more about this release.</p>\n"}
