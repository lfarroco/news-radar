It allows developers to create interactive graphics, animations, and other visualizations in the browser. Recently, p5.js has gained popularity among web developers for its ease of use and flexibility.</p>\n<p>The library comes with a built-in editor, but for serious work, developers need a proper setup with TypeScript, ESLint, and IDE support. Fortunately, there is a template available that includes all the necessary tools.</p>\n<p>To get started, developers can use the following command to create a new project:</p>\n<pre><code>npm create -y from-github padcom/p5 hello-world\n</code></pre>\n<p>After creating the project, developers can install the necessary packages using npm:</p>\n<pre><code>cd hello-world\nnpm install\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the project set up, developers can start coding. The p5.js library provides a variety of functions for creating shapes, colors, and animations. For example, the following code creates a canvas and draws a circle on it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function setup() {\n  createCanvas(400, 400);\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  background(220);\n  ellipse(200, 200, 50, 50);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>p5.js also has a large community of developers who contribute to the library and share their work. The library&#39;s website provides a reference guide with examples and tutorials to help developers get started.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, p5.js is a powerful library for web developers who want to create interactive graphics and visualizations. With its ease of use and flexibility, it is a great tool for both beginners and experienced developers.</p>\n"}
