It is designed to be used as a library, making it easy to integrate into existing projects. Rust&#39;s performance and safety features make it an ideal language for building such a tool.</p>\n<p>Bloop&#39;s search functionality is based on the popular code search tool, &quot;ack&quot;. It uses regular expressions to search for patterns in files, and can search through multiple directories at once. Bloop also supports searching through compressed files, such as gzip and bzip2.</p>\n<p>One of the main advantages of using Bloop is its speed. It is designed to be as fast as possible, and can search through large codebases in a matter of seconds. Bloop also supports parallel searching, which can further improve performance on multi-core systems.</p>\n<p>Bloop is open source and licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. It has gained a lot of popularity in the Rust community, with over 7k stars on GitHub and 407 forks.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use Bloop in Rust:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">use bloop::SearchOptions;\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut options = SearchOptions::new();\n    options.recursive(true);\n    options.add_search_path(PathBuf::from(&quot;.&quot;));\n    options.add_search_pattern(&quot;fn main()&quot;);\n\n    let results = bloop::search(&amp;options).unwrap();\n\n    for result in results {\n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, result.path().display());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This example searches for the pattern &quot;fn main()&quot; in the current directory and its subdirectories. The results are then printed to the console.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re looking for a fast and efficient code search engine for your Rust projects, Bloop is definitely worth checking out.</p>\n"}
