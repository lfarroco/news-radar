This framework supports various features such as flash attention, Int8 and GPTQ 4bit quantization, LoRA and LLaMA-Adapter fine-tuning, and pre-training. Lit-gpt is Apache 2.0-licensed and has already gained 1.3k stars and 99 forks on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Lit-gpt is built on top of PyTorch and provides a simple API for developers to use. It includes several pre-trained models such as Falcon, StableLM, Pythia, and INCITE, making it easy to get started with language modeling. </p>\n<p>Developers can also fine-tune their own models using the provided tools. Lit-gpt supports LoRA and LLaMA-Adapter fine-tuning, which are techniques that allow for faster and more efficient training of language models. </p>\n<p>One of the standout features of lit-gpt is its support for flash attention, which is a new type of attention mechanism that can be used to improve the performance of language models. Additionally, lit-gpt supports quantization, which can help reduce the memory and compute requirements of language models.</p>\n<p>Overall, lit-gpt is a powerful language model implementation that provides developers with a simple API and a range of features to work with. Its support for flash attention and quantization make it a great choice for developers looking to build efficient and high-performing language models.</p>\n"}
