In this tutorial, the author shows how to use Apache AGE with a Node.js application.</p>\n<p>What is Apache AGE?\nApache AGE is a graph database system that combines the benefits of a powerful relational database management system (PostgreSQL) with the flexibility and scalability of a graph database. This allows users to store, manage, and analyze large-scale graph data in a highly performant and scalable way.</p>\n<p>Prerequisites\nTo follow this tutorial, users need to have PostgreSQL version 11 or 12 installed on their machine, as well as Apache AGE. The author recommends following their comprehensive step-by-step guide for easy installation on Windows, which can be accessed here. Finally, users need to have Node.js installed.</p>\n<p>Step-by-Step Tutorial\nThe author provides a detailed step-by-step tutorial on how to use Apache AGE with a Node.js application. They cover topics such as creating a new database and table, inserting data, querying data, and more. They also provide code snippets to help users follow along.</p>\n<p>Conclusion\nApache AGE is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing large-scale graph data. By combining the benefits of PostgreSQL with the flexibility of a graph database, it provides users with a highly performant and scalable solution. This tutorial provides a great starting point for developers looking to integrate Apache AGE with their Node.js applications.</p>\n"}
