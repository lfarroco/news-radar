The tool is built on the GPT-3 language model, which has been trained on a large corpus of text data and can generate human-like text. </p>\n<p>With GPT-Engineer, developers can specify what they want to build, and the AI will ask for clarification if needed. The tool can also generate code snippets based on natural language input, making it easier for developers to write code. </p>\n<p>The tool is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to developers of all skill levels. It can be used for a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. </p>\n<p>GPT-Engineer is still in the early stages of development, but it has already generated a lot of interest in the developer community. Many developers are excited about the potential of AI tools like GPT-Engineer to streamline the coding process and make it easier for developers to build high-quality code. </p>\n<p>To use GPT-Engineer, developers can clone the repository from GitHub and follow the instructions provided in the README file. The tool is open source and released under the MIT license, so developers are free to use and modify it as they see fit. </p>\n<p>Overall, GPT-Engineer is an exciting new tool for developers that shows the potential of AI in the programming world. As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more tools like GPT-Engineer that make it easier for developers to build high-quality code.</p>\n"}
