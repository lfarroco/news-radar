They introduce a practical project, the Math Quiz, which helped them practice the basics of JavaScript while reinforcing their programming skills.</p>\n<p>The Math Quiz project aimed to generate random math questions, take user input, and provide feedback based on the correctness of the answer. The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to build the Math Quiz program, including generating random numbers, prompting the user with questions, checking answers, keeping track of scores, and generating new questions.</p>\n<p>This project is an excellent example of how to apply newly acquired knowledge to real-world scenarios and solidify the fundamentals of a programming language. It is a great way for developers to practice their JavaScript skills and expand their skill set.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to generate a random number within a range using JavaScript:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function getRandomNumber(min, max) {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconsole.log(getRandomNumber(1, 10)); // Output: Random number between 1 and 10\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overall, the Math Quiz project is an excellent resource for developers looking to practice their JavaScript skills. It provides a practical exercise to apply the basics of JavaScript while reinforcing programming skills.</p>\n"}
