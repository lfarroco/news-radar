The library features EnCodec, a state-of-the-art audio compressor/tokenizer, and MusicGen, a simple and controllable music generation LM with textual and melodic conditioning.</p>\n<p>EnCodec is a deep learning model that can compress and decompress audio signals without losing quality. It uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn a compact representation of the audio signal. EnCodec can also be used as a tokenizer to convert audio signals into a sequence of tokens that can be processed by other deep learning models.</p>\n<p>MusicGen is a language model that can generate music sequences based on textual and melodic conditioning. It uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn the patterns and structures of music. MusicGen can be trained on a variety of music genres and styles, and can generate new music sequences that are similar to the training data.</p>\n<p>Audiocraft is open source and released under the MIT license. It has gained popularity among developers who are interested in audio processing and generation with deep learning. Audiocraft can be used for a variety of applications, such as music generation, speech recognition, and audio compression.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use EnCodec to compress and decompress an audio signal in Python:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import torch\nimport audiocraft\n\n# Load an audio signal\naudio, sample_rate = audiocraft.load_audio(&#39;audio.wav&#39;)\n\n# Compress the audio signal\ncompressed = audiocraft.encode(audio)\n\n# Decompress the audio signal\nreconstructed = audiocraft.decode(compressed)\n\n# Save the reconstructed audio signal\naudiocraft.save_audio(reconstructed, &#39;reconstructed_audio.wav&#39;, sample_rate)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Audiocraft is a powerful library for audio processing and generation with deep learning. It provides developers with state-of-the-art tools for compressing, tokenizing, and generating audio signals. If you&#39;re interested in audio processing and generation with deep learning, Audiocraft is definitely worth checking out.</p>\n"}
