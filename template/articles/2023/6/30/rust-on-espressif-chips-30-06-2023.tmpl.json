One of the notable advancements is the support for the riscv32imac compilation target on ESP32-C6 &amp; ESP32-H2, which allows developers to utilize the standard library port. Furthermore, the upcoming release of the Rust compiler will include the rust-analyzer-proc-macro-srv component, addressing various reported issues with rust analyzer. The article also highlights the significant improvements in ESP32-H2 support, bringing it to the same level as other chips within just a few months. The addition of async support in esp-hal, including async serial read and write operations, I2C driver, and multicore async GPIO, further enhances the capabilities of Rust on Espressif chips.</p>\n"}
