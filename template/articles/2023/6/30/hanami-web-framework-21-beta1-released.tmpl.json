This release introduces hanami-view, the new view layer for Hanami apps. Similar to actions, views in Hanami are standalone, callable objects that can work with arguments and dependencies to prepare exposures for rendering templates. Hanami views are built on top of Tilt, providing support for a wide range of template engines including ERB, Haml, and Slim. The framework also includes a range of built-in helpers for creating forms and generating HTML. Developers can also create their own helpers using expressive Ruby syntax. Hanami makes it easy to generate matching views for actions and provides a convenient way to generate views directly. With this release, Hanami continues to enhance its vision for full stack web applications.</p>\n"}
