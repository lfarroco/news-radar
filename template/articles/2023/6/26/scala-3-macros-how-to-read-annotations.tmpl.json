The article shows how macros can be used to generate code at compile time, and how annotations can be used to provide additional information to the macro.</p>\n<p>The author starts by explaining the basics of Scala 3 macros and how they differ from Scala 2 macros. They then introduce the concept of annotations and how they can be used to provide metadata to the macro. The article provides a code example of how to read annotations from a macro, using the new <code>inline</code> keyword in Scala 3.</p>\n<p>The article also discusses some of the limitations of reading annotations from macros, such as the inability to read annotations from inherited members. However, the author provides a workaround for this limitation by using a macro annotation.</p>\n<p>For developers who are interested in Scala 3 macros and want to learn more about how to read annotations from them, this article is a great resource. The code examples provided are clear and concise, making it easy to follow along and understand the concepts presented.</p>\n<p>Overall, the article is a valuable contribution to the Scala community and provides useful information for developers who are interested in using macros and annotations in their projects.</p>\n"}
