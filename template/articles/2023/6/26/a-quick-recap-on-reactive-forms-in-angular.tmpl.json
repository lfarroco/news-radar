If you need a quick recap, there are many resources available online. One such resource is the official Angular documentation, which provides detailed information on reactive forms. However, if you find it overwhelming, you can check out other resources like Angular University, which offers a comprehensive course on reactive forms. </p>\n<p>Reactive forms allow developers to build complex forms with ease. They provide a way to handle form data and validation in a reactive way. Reactive forms use reactive programming techniques to manage form data, which makes them more flexible and powerful than template-driven forms. </p>\n<p>To get started with reactive forms, developers need to import the ReactiveFormsModule module from &#39;@angular/forms&#39;. They can then use the FormBuilder service to create form controls and groups. </p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of creating a simple form control using the FormBuilder service:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">import { Component } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\nimport { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from &#39;@angular/forms&#39;;\n\n@Component({\n  selector: &#39;app-root&#39;,\n  template: `\n    &lt;form [formGroup]=&quot;myForm&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; formControlName=&quot;name&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n  `\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  myForm: FormGroup;\n\n  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {\n    this.myForm = this.fb.group({\n      name: &#39;&#39;\n    });\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Reactive forms are a powerful tool for building complex forms in Angular.
