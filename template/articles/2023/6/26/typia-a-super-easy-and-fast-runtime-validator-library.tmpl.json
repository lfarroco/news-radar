It is super-easy to use and only requires TypeScript types, eliminating the need for extra schema definitions. Typia can analyze TypeScript by itself and generate optimal validation code for each type. The library is open source and available on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Typia&#39;s playground demo showcases how the library works. Developers can test their code and see how Typia generates the validation code for each type. This makes it easy to integrate Typia into their projects and improve performance.</p>\n<p>The library is especially useful for developers working with Node.js and TypeScript. It can help them validate user input, API responses, and more. Typia&#39;s speed and ease of use make it a valuable tool for any developer looking to improve their workflow.</p>\n<p>To get started with Typia, developers can install it via npm. They can then import it into their project and start using it right away. Here&#39;s an example of how to use Typia to validate a simple object:</p>\n<pre><code>import { validate } from &#39;typia&#39;;\n\ninterface Person {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n\nconst person: Person = {\n  name: &#39;John&#39;,\n  age: 30,\n};\n\nconst isValid = validate(Person, person);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, Typia validates the <code>person</code> object against the <code>Person</code> interface and returns a boolean value indicating whether the object is valid or not.</p>\n<p>Overall, Typia is a powerful and efficient runtime validator library that can help developers save time and improve performance. Its ease of use and speed make it a valuable tool for any developer working with TypeScript and Node.js.</p>\n"}
