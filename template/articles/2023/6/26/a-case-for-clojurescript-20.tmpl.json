The author of this article argues that ClojureScript 2.0 is a significant improvement over its predecessor, with better performance and a more streamlined development experience.</p>\n<p>One of the major improvements in ClojureScript 2.0 is the introduction of a new compiler, dubbed the &quot;new compiler.&quot; This compiler is faster and more efficient than the previous compiler, resulting in faster compile times and smaller output files. Additionally, the new compiler provides better error messages and more helpful warnings, making it easier for developers to debug their code.</p>\n<p>Another improvement in ClojureScript 2.0 is the introduction of a new macro system, which allows developers to write more concise and expressive code. The new macro system also makes it easier to write code that is both performant and maintainable.</p>\n<p>ClojureScript 2.0 also includes several new features, such as support for JavaScript modules and a new data structure called &quot;spec.&quot; These features make it easier for developers to integrate with existing JavaScript code and write more robust and reliable applications.</p>\n<p>Overall, ClojureScript 2.0 is a significant improvement over its predecessor, with better performance, a more streamlined development experience, and several new features. For developers looking to write performant and maintainable JavaScript applications, ClojureScript 2.0 is definitely worth considering. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-(defn\">  (println &quot;Hello, world!&quot;))```\n</code></pre>\n"}
