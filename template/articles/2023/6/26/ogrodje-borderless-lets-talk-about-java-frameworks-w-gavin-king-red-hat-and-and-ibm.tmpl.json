Ogrodje is a lightweight framework that allows developers to build web applications without being tied to a specific technology stack. </p>\n<p>King explains that Ogrodje is designed to be &quot;borderless&quot;, meaning that it can be used with any technology stack. This allows developers to choose the best tools for their specific project, rather than being limited by the framework they are using. </p>\n<p>One of the key features of Ogrodje is its support for reactive programming. Reactive programming allows developers to build applications that are more responsive and scalable. Ogrodje also includes support for server-side rendering, which can improve the performance of web applications. </p>\n<p>For developers who are interested in trying out Ogrodje, King recommends starting with the Getting Started guide on the project&#39;s GitHub page. The guide includes examples of how to use Ogrodje to build a simple web application. </p>\n<p>Overall, Ogrodje is a promising framework for Java developers who want to build web applications without being tied to a specific technology stack. Its support for reactive programming and server-side rendering make it a good choice for building scalable and responsive applications.</p>\n"}
