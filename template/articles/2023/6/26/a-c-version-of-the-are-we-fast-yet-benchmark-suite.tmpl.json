The benchmark suite is designed to measure the performance of different programming languages and their implementations. It consists of a set of micro-benchmarks that test various aspects of a language&#39;s performance, such as arithmetic operations, memory allocation, and function calls.</p>\n<p>The C++ version of the benchmark suite includes 29 micro-benchmarks that test the performance of different C++ features, such as templates, exceptions, and virtual functions. The benchmarks are designed to be run on different compilers and platforms to provide a comprehensive view of C++ performance.</p>\n<p>Developers can use the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite to compare the performance of different C++ compilers and optimization settings. The suite can also be used to identify performance bottlenecks in C++ code and to optimize it for better performance.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to run the benchmark suite on a Linux machine using the GCC compiler:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/rochus-keller/Are-we-fast-yet.git\ncd Are-we-fast-yet/Cpp\nmake -f Makefile.gcc\n./run.sh\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output of the benchmark suite includes the execution time of each micro-benchmark and a summary of the results. Developers can use this information to identify the fastest and slowest performing C++ features and to optimize their code accordingly.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite is a valuable tool for C++ developers who want to optimize their code for better performance. The addition of a C++ version of the suite provides developers with a comprehensive view of C++ performance across different compilers and platforms.</p>\n"}
