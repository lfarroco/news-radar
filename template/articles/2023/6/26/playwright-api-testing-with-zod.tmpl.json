Playwright is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API to control Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that allows developers to define and validate data structures.</p>\n<p>The article shows how to use Playwright to launch a browser and interact with an API. It then demonstrates how to use zod to validate the API&#39;s responses. The author provides code snippets throughout the article to illustrate the concepts.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of using zod is that it allows developers to define their schemas using TypeScript interfaces. This provides type safety and makes it easier to maintain the codebase. The author also notes that zod has a small bundle size and is easy to use.</p>\n<p>The article concludes by stating that using Playwright and zod together can provide a powerful toolset for API testing. The author encourages developers to try out these tools and experiment with different testing strategies.</p>\n<p>Overall, this article is a useful resource for developers who are interested in testing APIs using Playwright and zod. The code snippets and explanations provided make it easy to understand the concepts and get started with testing.</p>\n"}
