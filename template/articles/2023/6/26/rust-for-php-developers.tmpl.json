In this video, Nuno Maduro introduces Rust to PHP developers and shows how it can be used to write high-performance and safe code.</p>\n<p>Rust&#39;s syntax is similar to that of C++, but with modern features such as pattern matching, algebraic data types, and closures. It also has a robust package manager called Cargo, which makes it easy to manage dependencies and build projects.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of Rust is its ownership model, which ensures that memory is managed safely and efficiently. This is achieved through a system of ownership and borrowing, which prevents common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences and use-after-free bugs.</p>\n<p>For PHP developers, Rust can be a great choice for writing low-level code that needs to be fast and secure. It can also be used to write system utilities, web servers, and even games.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of a simple Rust program that prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overall, Rust is a powerful language that offers a unique combination of performance, safety, and modern features. While it may take some time to learn, it&#39;s definitely worth considering for any developer who wants to write fast and secure code.</p>\n"}
