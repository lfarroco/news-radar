The library is designed to work with Angular, React, Vue, and Vanilla JavaScript. It is a lightweight library that can be easily integrated into any web application.</p>\n<p>Input masking is a technique that restricts the input of users to a specific format. For example, a phone number input field can be restricted to only accept numbers and hyphens in a specific format. Maskito provides a wide range of pre-built masks for different types of inputs, such as phone numbers, credit card numbers, dates, and more.</p>\n<p>The library is highly customizable and allows developers to create their own masks. It also provides a real-time preview of the mask as the user types, making it easier to understand the input format. Maskito is also compatible with form validation libraries, such as Angular Forms and React Forms.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use Maskito with Angular:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">import { MaskitoDirective } from &#39;maskito&#39;;\n\n@Component({\n  selector: &#39;app-form&#39;,\n  template: `\n    &lt;form&gt;\n      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; maskito=&quot;phone&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;phoneNumber&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n  `,\n})\nexport class FormComponent {\n  phoneNumber: string;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, the <code>MaskitoDirective</code> is imported and used in the <code>input</code> element with the <code>maskito</code> attribute set to <code>phone</code>. The <code>[(ngModel)]</code> directive is used to bind the input value to the <code>phoneNumber</code> variable.</p>\n<p>Maskito is a great solution for developers who want to provide a better user experience for their web applications. It simplifies the input masking process and provides a wide range of pre-built masks for different types of inputs.</p>\n"}
