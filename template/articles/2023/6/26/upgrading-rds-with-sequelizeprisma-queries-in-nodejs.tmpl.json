According to the official documentation, it is not necessary to shut down the server during the upgrade process. However, it is recommended to test the application after the upgrade to ensure that everything is working correctly.</p>\n<p>Developers can also take advantage of the RDS snapshot feature to create a backup of their database before upgrading. This way, if something goes wrong during the upgrade process, they can easily restore the database to its previous state.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to create an RDS snapshot using the AWS SDK for Node.js:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const AWS = require(&#39;aws-sdk&#39;);\nconst rds = new AWS.RDS();\n\nconst params = {\n  DBInstanceIdentifier: &#39;your-db-instance-id&#39;,\n  DBSnapshotIdentifier: &#39;your-db-snapshot-id&#39;\n};\n\nrds.createDBSnapshot(params, (err, data) =&gt; {\n  if (err) console.log(err, err.stack);\n  else console.log(data);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>In conclusion, upgrading RDS with Sequelize or Prisma queries in Node.js does not require shutting down the server. However, developers should test their application after the upgrade and consider creating an RDS snapshot as a backup.</p>\n"}
