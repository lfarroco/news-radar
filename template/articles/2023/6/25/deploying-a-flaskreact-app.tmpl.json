Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, while React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. When combined, they can create powerful web applications. However, deploying and hosting a Flask+React app on a cloud server like AWS can be a daunting task for beginners.</p>\n<p>To start, it&#39;s important to understand that Flask and React are two separate entities that communicate with each other through APIs. Therefore, they need to be deployed and hosted separately. The Flask API can be hosted on a server using a web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI, while the React app can be hosted on a static file server like Nginx or Apache.</p>\n<p>There are several tutorials available online that can guide developers on how to deploy and host Flask and React apps separately. For example, the Flask Mega-Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg covers the deployment of Flask apps using various web servers. On the other hand, the React documentation provides a guide on how to deploy React apps using a static file server.</p>\n<p>Once both the Flask API and React app are deployed and hosted, they can communicate with each other through APIs. This can be done by specifying the API endpoint in the React app and making requests to the Flask API using libraries like Axios or Fetch.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, deploying and hosting a Flask+React app on a cloud server like AWS requires separate deployment and hosting of the Flask API and React app. There are several tutorials available online that can guide developers on how to deploy and host these tools separately. By following these tutorials and using APIs to communicate between Flask and React, developers can create powerful web applications.</p>\n"}
