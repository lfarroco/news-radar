Combining the two can lead to a more efficient and streamlined development process. However, it can be challenging to integrate React with an existing Django app.</p>\n<p>One approach is to keep the portions of the app that require React separate from the rest of the app. This can be achieved by creating a new Django app that serves as the entry point for the React code. This new app can be responsible for rendering the React components and handling the communication between the React code and the Django backend.</p>\n<p>To interlink the two apps, developers can use Django REST Framework (DRF) to create an API that exposes the necessary data from the Django backend. The React code can then make requests to this API to retrieve the required data.</p>\n<p>Another option is to use Django&#39;s built-in support for serving static files. Developers can create a new directory in the Django app&#39;s static files directory and place the React code there. They can then use Django&#39;s template system to include the React code in the appropriate templates.</p>\n<p>Overall, integrating React with an existing Django app can be a complex process, but it can also lead to significant improvements in the app&#39;s user interface and development process. By keeping the React code separate from the rest of the app and using DRF or Django&#39;s built-in support for serving static files, developers can achieve a more efficient and streamlined integration.</p>\n"}
