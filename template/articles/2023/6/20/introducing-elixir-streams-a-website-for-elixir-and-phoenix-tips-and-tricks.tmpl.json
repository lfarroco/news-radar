It was created in 2011 by Jos√© Valim, a former Rails core team member. Elixir is known for its scalability, fault-tolerance, and ease of use. Phoenix, on the other hand, is a web framework for Elixir that is similar to Ruby on Rails. It was created in 2014 by Chris McCord, and it has gained a lot of popularity in recent years.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in learning more about Elixir and Phoenix, you might want to check out Elixir Streams. It&#39;s a new website that provides tips, tricks, and courses on Elixir and Phoenix.</p>\n<p>The website is divided into several sections. The first section is called &quot;Tips and Tricks,&quot; and it provides short articles on various topics related to Elixir and Phoenix. For example, you can learn how to use Ecto, a database wrapper for Elixir, or how to use Phoenix LiveView, a real-time web framework.</p>\n<p>The second section is called &quot;Courses,&quot; and it provides in-depth courses on Elixir and Phoenix. The courses are created by experienced developers, and they cover a wide range of topics. For example, you can learn how to build a real-time chat application with Phoenix LiveView, or how to use GenServer, a behaviour in Elixir that allows you to create processes.</p>\n<p>The third section is called &quot;Community,&quot; and it provides a forum where you can ask questions and share your knowledge with other developers. The forum is moderated by experienced developers, so you can be sure that you&#39;ll get high-quality answers to your questions.</p>\n<p>Overall, Elixir Streams is a great resource for developers who want to learn more about Elixir and Phoenix. The website is well-designed, easy to navigate, and provides a lot of valuable information. If you&#39;re interested in functional programming or web development, you should definitely check it out.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use Ecto to query a database in Elixir:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elixir\">defmodule MyApp.Repo do\n  use Ecto.Repo,\n    otp_app: :my_app,\n    adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres\n\n  def get_users_by_name(name) do\n    from(u in User, where: u.name == ^name)\n    |&gt; Repo.all()\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, we define a module called <code>MyApp.Repo</code> that uses Ecto to query a database. We define a function called <code>get_users_by_name</code> that takes a name as an argument and returns a list of users with that name. We use the <code>from</code> macro to construct a query, and we use the <code>where</code> macro to filter the results. Finally, we use the <code>Repo.all</code> function to execute the query and return the results.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Elixir Streams is a valuable resource for developers who want to learn more about Elixir and Phoenix. Whether you&#39;re a beginner or an experienced developer, you&#39;ll find a lot of useful information on the website. So why not give it a try and see what you can learn?</p>\n"}
