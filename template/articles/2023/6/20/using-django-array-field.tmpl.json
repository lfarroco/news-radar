This can be useful for storing lists of items, such as tags or categories, without requiring a separate table for each list. </p>\n<p>In a recent article on Medium, the author explains how to use ArrayField in Django. They provide a step-by-step guide to creating a model with an ArrayField, including how to specify the data type of the array elements. They also show how to use the Django ORM to query and manipulate the data in the ArrayField.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to create a model with an ArrayField for storing tags:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField\n\nclass Article(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    tags = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=50))\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a model with a title field and a tags field that can store an array of strings up to 50 characters long.</p>\n<p>The article also covers some advanced features of ArrayField, such as using custom lookups and indexing. It&#39;s a useful resource for Django developers who want to take advantage of this feature.</p>\n<p>Overall, ArrayField is a powerful tool for simplifying database design in Django. By storing arrays of data in a single field, developers can reduce the complexity of their database schema and make their code more efficient.</p>\n"}
