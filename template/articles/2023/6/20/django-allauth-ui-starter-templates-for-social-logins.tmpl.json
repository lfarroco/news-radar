Developed by Dani Hodovic, the templates provide a quick and easy way to get started with social authentication in Django projects.</p>\n<p>The templates include login and registration pages for popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They are designed to be easily customizable, allowing developers to quickly integrate social authentication into their Django projects.</p>\n<p>To use the templates, developers need to have Django AllAuth installed in their project. Once installed, the templates can be easily integrated into the project by copying the relevant files and making any necessary modifications.</p>\n<p>Django AllAuth UI is a useful tool for developers who want to add social authentication to their Django projects without having to spend time designing and implementing the necessary pages themselves. The templates are also a great starting point for developers who are new to Django AllAuth and want to learn how to use it.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of how to use the Facebook login template:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">{% extends &quot;account/base.html&quot; %}\n\n{% load socialaccount %}\n\n{% block content %}\n    &lt;h2&gt;Facebook Login&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n    {% provider_login_url &quot;facebook&quot; method=&quot;oauth2&quot; %}\n{% endblock %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overall, Django AllAuth UI is a valuable resource for developers looking to streamline their social authentication implementation in Django projects.</p>\n"}
