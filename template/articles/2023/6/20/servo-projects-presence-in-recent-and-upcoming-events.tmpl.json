Martin Robinson from the Servo project team gave a lighting talk about the project at the RustNL 2023 conference in Amsterdam in May of 2023. He discussed the project&#39;s current plans and explored the possibility of using Servo in various Rust application frameworks.</p>\n<p>In June of 2023, the Servo project team participated in the Web Engines Hackfest 2023. Delan Azabani gave a talk about the project, providing valuable insights into the teamâ€™s work in the first half of the year and its plans for the second half. The talk also covered running some Servo demos, the status of floats, and the evolution of the layout system. Discussions were also held around the future of the shared style crate in Gecko and Servo.</p>\n<p>During the same event, a breakout session about Servo was held, addressing various topics such as how to coordinate development efforts between Mozilla and Gecko on the shared webrender and style crates. Of particular interest was the implementation and challenges of a new embedding.</p>\n<p>The Servo project is written in Rust, a programming language that has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its performance, safety, and ease of use. Rust&#39;s memory safety features make it an ideal language for systems programming, and it has been adopted by companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.</p>\n<p>Developers interested in the Servo project can contribute to its development on GitHub and get involved in the community through the project&#39;s Mastodon and Twitter accounts. The project also has a documentation website and a code of conduct for contributors.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use Servo in a Rust application:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">extern crate servo;\n\nfn main() {\n    let url = &quot;https://www.example.com&quot;;\n    let mut browser = servo::ServoBrowser::new();\n    browser.load_url(url);\n    browser.wait_for_page_load();\n    let html = browser.get_page_source();\n    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, html);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, the ServoBrowser struct is used to load a URL and retrieve its HTML source code. The wait_for_page_load method blocks until the page has finished loading, and the get_page_source method returns the HTML code as a string.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Servo project&#39;s presence in recent and upcoming events highlights its importance in the web browser engine landscape. With its use of Rust and focus on performance and safety, it is a promising project for developers interested in systems programming and web development.</p>\n"}
