Bash provides a pseudo-signal called EXIT that can be trapped, allowing commands or functions to execute when the script exits for any reason.</p>\n<p>To use exit traps, simply define a &quot;finish&quot; function and place any code that needs to be run in it. For example, a common use case is creating a temporary scratch directory and deleting it after. Intermediate or temporary files can then be manipulated in the scratch directory without worry.</p>\n<p>Without exit traps, cleanup operations can become messy and unreliable. For example, removing a scratch directory without the trap can lead to errors and leftover files.</p>\n<p>Exit traps can also be useful for keeping services up, even in the face of runtime errors. For example, a script that temporarily stops a server for maintenance can ensure that it starts again at the end, regardless of any errors that may occur.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of using exit traps to stop and restart a MongoDB server on an Ubuntu machine:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\nfinish () {\n  # Restart MongoDB\n  sudo service mongodb start\n}\n\n# Stop MongoDB\nsudo service mongodb stop\n\n# Do maintenance tasks here\n\n# Ensure MongoDB is restarted even if there is an error\ntrap finish EXIT\n</code></pre>\n<p>By using exit traps, Bash scripts can be made more reliable and robust, ensuring that necessary cleanup operations are always performed and services are kept up, no matter what.</p>\n"}
