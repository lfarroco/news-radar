It allows developers to define their database schema in Rust code and then generate type-safe Rust structs and functions to interact with the database.</p>\n<p>One of the main advantages of QueryX is its focus on type safety. By defining the database schema in Rust code, developers can catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This can save a lot of time and effort in debugging and testing. Additionally, QueryX generates Rust code that is type-safe, meaning that developers can be confident that their code is interacting with the database in a safe and predictable way.</p>\n<p>QueryX also supports a wide range of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more. This makes it a versatile choice for developers who need to work with different databases in their projects.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s take a closer look at how QueryX works.</p>\n<p>Defining the Database Schema</p>\n<p>The first step in using QueryX is to define the database schema in Rust code. This is done using a simple and intuitive syntax that is similar to defining a Rust struct. Here&#39;s an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">use queryx::queryx;\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, queryx::FromRow)]\nstruct User {\n    id: i32,\n    name: String,\n    email: String,\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, we define a <code>User</code> struct that has three fields: <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>email</code>. The <code>queryx::FromRow</code> attribute tells QueryX that this struct can be used to represent a row in the database.</p>\n<p>Generating the Rust Code</p>\n<p>Once we have defined the database schema, we can use QueryX to generate Rust code that interacts with the database. This is done using the <code>query_as!</code> macro, which takes a SQL query and a Rust struct and generates code that executes the query and returns the results as instances of the struct.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let users: Vec&lt;User&gt; = query_as!(\n    User,\n    &quot;SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE name = $1&quot;,\n    &quot;Alice&quot;\n)\n.fetch_all(&amp;pool)\n.await?;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, we use the <code>query_as!</code> macro to generate code that executes a SQL query to select all users with the name &quot;Alice&quot;. The <code>User</code> struct is used to represent the rows returned by the query. The <code>fetch_all</code> method executes the query and returns a vector of <code>User</code> instances.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>QueryX is a new ORM library for Rust that provides a schema-first and type-safe approach to database interactions. It allows developers to define their database schema in Rust code and then generate type-safe Rust structs and functions to interact with the database. QueryX is a versatile choice for developers who need to work with different databases in their projects and provides a high level of type safety that can save a lot of time and effort in debugging and testing.</p>\n"}
