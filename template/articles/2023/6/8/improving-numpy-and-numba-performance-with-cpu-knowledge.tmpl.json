However, optimizing the code for performance can be a challenge. In this article, we will explore how understanding CPU architecture can help improve the performance of Numpy and Numba code.</p>\n<p>The article starts by introducing Numba, a just-in-time compiler that allows you to write Python code that gets compiled at runtime to machine code. It promises to deliver the kind of speed improvements youâ€™d get from languages like C, Fortran, or Rust. However, the initial Numba code may not be faster than the NumPy equivalent. </p>\n<p>The article then explains how understanding CPU architecture can help optimize the code. It uses a simple image-processing problem to demonstrate how to tweak the code to run 25x faster than the original version. The problem involves removing noise from an image by setting all values below a certain threshold to complete black.</p>\n<p>The article reviews how modern CPUs work and the limits of compilers. It then shows how to optimize the code by taking advantage of CPU architecture. For example, using SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions can speed up the code by processing multiple data elements in parallel.</p>\n<p>The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding CPU architecture for optimizing code performance. It also provides code snippets to help developers get started with optimizing their Numpy and Numba code.</p>\n<p>In summary, this article provides valuable insights into how understanding CPU architecture can help improve the performance of Numpy and Numba code. By optimizing the code for CPU architecture, developers can achieve significant speed improvements in their applications.</p>\n"}
