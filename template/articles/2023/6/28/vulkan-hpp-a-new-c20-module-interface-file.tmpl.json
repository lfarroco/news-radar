This new addition aims to enhance the development experience for C++ developers by providing a more modern and efficient way to include Vulkan-Hpp in their projects.</p>\n<p>The C++20 module interface file allows developers to import Vulkan-Hpp as a module, eliminating the need for header files and improving compilation times. This new feature is especially beneficial for large-scale projects where reducing build times is crucial.</p>\n<p>To import Vulkan-Hpp as a module, developers can use the following code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">import vulkan;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This simple import statement enables developers to access all the Vulkan-Hpp functionality within their C++20 projects.</p>\n<p>In addition to the module interface file, Vulkan-Hpp continues to provide extensive support for the Vulkan API, making it easier for developers to work with Vulkan in C++. With Vulkan-Hpp, developers can write efficient and high-performance graphics applications while leveraging the latest features of the Vulkan API.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates on Vulkan-Hpp and other programming languages and frameworks in our magazine, Dev Radar.</p>\n"}
