In this article, we will explore some tips and tricks to improve the Button component in React.</p>\n<p>To start, let&#39;s look at the basic Button component that we will build upon:</p>\n<pre><code>export function Button(props: React.ComponentProps&lt;&quot;button&quot;&gt;) {\n  return (\n    &lt;button {...props}&gt;\n      {props.children}\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Assuming that the buttons are unstyled, which is the default for many CSS frameworks like Tailwind, we can use some sane defaults for the design. Placing the Button component on a page without any additional props or parameters should result in a button that fits in the design and is easily recognizable as a button.</p>\n<p>A recognizable button tends to follow these design characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Horizontal padding is twice the vertical padding</li>\n<li>High contrast colors are reserved for important buttons</li>\n<li>Limit the number of buttons with eye-catching colors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can achieve these defaults by adding some CSS to the Button component:</p>\n<pre><code>export function Button(props: React.ComponentProps&lt;&quot;button&quot;&gt;) {\n  return (\n    &lt;button\n      {...props}\n      className=&quot;px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50&quot;\n    &gt;\n      {props.children}\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This CSS uses Tailwind classes to set the horizontal padding, background color, and border radius. It also adds some hover and focus styles to make the button more interactive.</p>\n<p>Another important consideration is the default type of the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. By default, the type is &quot;submit,&quot; which can cause issues if the button is not intended to submit a form. To avoid this, we can set the type to &quot;button&quot; by default:</p>\n<pre><code>export function Button(props: React.ComponentProps&lt;&quot;button&quot;&gt;) {\n  return (\n    &lt;button\n      {...props}\n      type={props.type ?? &quot;button&quot;}\n      className=&quot;px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50&quot;\n    &gt;\n      {props.children}\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code uses the nullish coalescing operator (<code>??</code>) to set the type to &quot;button&quot; if it is not already set.</p>\n<p>Finally, we can add some additional props to make the Button component more flexible. For example, we can add a <code>size</code> prop to set the font size and padding:</p>\n<pre><code>export function Button(props: React.ComponentProps&lt;&quot;button&quot;&gt; &amp; { size?: &quot;sm&quot; | &quot;md&quot; | &quot;lg&quot; }) {\n  const { size = &quot;md&quot;, ...rest } = props;\n  const fontSize = size === &quot;sm&quot; ? &quot;text-sm&quot; : size === &quot;lg&quot; ? &quot;text-lg&quot; : &quot;text-base&quot;;\n  const padding = size === &quot;sm&quot; ? &quot;px-2 py-1&quot; : size === &quot;lg&quot; ? &quot;px-6 py-4&quot; : &quot;px-4 py-2&quot;;\n  return (\n    &lt;button\n      {...rest}\n      type={rest.type ?? &quot;button&quot;}\n      className={`text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50 ${fontSize} ${padding}`}\n    &gt;\n      {rest.children}\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code adds a <code>size</code> prop that can be set to &quot;sm,&quot; &quot;md,&quot; or &quot;lg&quot; to adjust the font size and padding. It also uses some conditional logic to set the appropriate classes based on the size prop.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, creating a Button component in React requires careful consideration of the design and flexibility. By using some sane defaults, setting the default type to &quot;button,&quot; and adding some additional props, we can create a Button component that is both easy to use and flexible enough to fit various use cases.</p>\n"}
