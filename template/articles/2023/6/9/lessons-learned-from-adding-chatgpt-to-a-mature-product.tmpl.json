ChatGPT is a language model that generates human-like responses to user inputs. The author highlighted some key lessons he learned during the process.</p>\n<p>Lesson 1: Your AI interface primes how users are going to engage with it.\nThe author found that the way the AI interface is presented to users can influence how they interact with it. For example, Mito AI users tended to stick to simple transformations rather than asking for more complex tasks. The author suggests that AI interfaces should be designed to encourage users to explore the full range of capabilities.</p>\n<p>Lesson 2: Code generation needs to be coupled with tools to understand the impact of generated code.\nThe author notes that ChatGPT can generate code snippets that may have unintended consequences. To mitigate this risk, he recommends coupling code generation with tools that can analyze the impact of the generated code. This can help developers catch potential issues before they become problems.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the author&#39;s experience with ChatGPT highlights the importance of designing AI interfaces that encourage users to explore the full range of capabilities and coupling code generation with tools to understand the impact of generated code. As AI becomes more prevalent in software development, these lessons will become increasingly important for developers to keep in mind.</p>\n"}
