However, frontend developers often face challenges when working with backend servers that are not yet ready, or when they need to test their code without connecting to a live backend server. This is where the NestJS Backend Server Simulator comes in.</p>\n<p>Jeongho Nam, a developer and contributor to the NestJS community, has developed a library called Nestia that provides a backend server simulator for NestJS. With this library, frontend developers can build a backend server simulator with just one line of code, without the need for a live backend server.</p>\n<p>The Nestia library allows frontend developers to start development even if the backend server is not ready. This is a game-changer for frontend development, as it saves time and resources that would otherwise be spent waiting for the backend server to be ready. The simulator also eliminates the need for the backend server to waste time on mock-up data composition.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use the NestJS Backend Server Simulator:</p>\n<pre><code>const article: IBbsArticle = await api.functional.bbs.articles.store(\n  { \n    random: true, // activate simulator\n    host: &quot;http://127.0.0.1&quot;, // not important when simulating\n  },\n  &quot;notice&quot;,\n  {\n    title: &quot;Hello, world!&quot;,\n    content: &quot;This is a test article.&quot;,\n  },\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition to the backend server simulator, Nestia provides many other convenient and powerful features that can help frontend developers increase their productivity and gain both high performance and easy development. Some of these features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic end-to-end (e2e) functions generator</li>\n<li>NestJS simulator for frontend developers</li>\n<li>SDK library for frontend developers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The automatic e2e functions generator is a particularly useful feature that allows developers to generate e2e test functions automatically, saving time and effort. The NestJS simulator for frontend developers provides a simulated environment that mimics the behavior of a live backend server, allowing developers to test their code without connecting to a live server.</p>\n<p>Overall, the NestJS Backend Server Simulator provided by Nestia is a powerful tool that can help frontend developers save time and resources while increasing their productivity. With its easy-to-use interface and powerful features, it is a must-have for any developer working with NestJS.</p>\n"}
