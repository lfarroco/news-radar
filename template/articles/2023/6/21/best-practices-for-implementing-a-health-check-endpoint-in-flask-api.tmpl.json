It is known for its simplicity and flexibility. However, when building an API with Flask, it is important to ensure that the application is always up and running. This is where a health-check endpoint comes in.</p>\n<p>A health-check endpoint is a path or blueprint that can be used to check the status of the application. It can be used to check database connectivity, pings, roundtrip request timings, and other important metrics.</p>\n<p>To implement a health-check endpoint in Flask, there are a few best practices to follow. First, it is recommended to create a separate blueprint for the health-check endpoint. This makes it easier to manage and test the endpoint separately from the rest of the application.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the endpoint should return a JSON response with a status code of 200 if the application is healthy. If there are any issues, the endpoint should return a status code of 500 along with an error message.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to implement a health-check endpoint in Flask:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Blueprint, jsonify\n\nhealth_check_bp = Blueprint(&#39;health_check&#39;, __name__)\n\n@health_check_bp.route(&#39;/health-check&#39;)\ndef health_check():\n    # Check database connectivity, pings, roundtrip request timings, etc\n    # Return a JSON response with a status code of 200 if the application is healthy\n    # Return a status code of 500 along with an error message if there are any issues\n    return jsonify({&#39;status&#39;: &#39;ok&#39;}), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>By following these best practices, developers can ensure that their Flask API is always up and running. It also makes it easier to diagnose and fix any issues that may arise.</p>\n"}
