This tool is designed to help developers and data scientists streamline their workflow and improve their productivity.</p>\n<p>AI Workbooks provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create, edit, and run code. It supports popular programming languages such as Python, R, and Julia. The notebooks are also equipped with pre-installed libraries and frameworks commonly used in AI development, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.</p>\n<p>One of the key features of AI Workbooks is its support for LLMs (Language Model Models). LLMs are a type of AI model that is capable of understanding and generating human-like language. With AI Workbooks, users can easily create and train LLMs using popular libraries such as Hugging Face&#39;s Transformers.</p>\n<p>In addition to LLMs, AI Workbooks also supports image and audio models. Users can easily import and preprocess their data, train their models, and visualize their results all within the same notebook interface.</p>\n<p>AI Workbooks also supports collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same notebook simultaneously. Users can share their notebooks with others and collaborate in real-time, making it easier to work on projects with remote teams.</p>\n<p>To get started with AI Workbooks, users can clone the Getting Started Workbook, which provides a quick and easy way to bootstrap their notebook. The tool is available for free on LastMile AI&#39;s website and can be run on any modern web browser.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, AI Workbooks is a powerful tool for developers and data scientists working on AI projects. Its user-friendly interface, support for popular programming languages and AI frameworks, and collaboration features make it a valuable addition to any AI development workflow. With AI Workbooks, users can streamline their workflow, improve their productivity, and focus on what really matters - building better AI models.</p>\n"}
