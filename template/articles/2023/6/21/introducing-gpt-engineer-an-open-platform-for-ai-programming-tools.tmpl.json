The project was started by a developer during their spare time and has gained attention from the open source community. </p>\n<p>The mission of GPT Engineer is to engage developers in how building software can and will change. The project is still in its early stages, but the flexible technical philosophy behind it aims to make it work well. The community surrounding the project is encouraged to contribute ideas and suggestions to help improve it.</p>\n<p>GPT Engineer is designed to guide LLM&#39;s (large language models) and provide a space to combine tricks for better results. The platform is built on top of GPT-3 and aims to make it easier for developers to experiment with and build their own AI programming tools. </p>\n<p>Developers can find more information about GPT Engineer on its GitHub page. The project is open source and welcomes contributions from the community. </p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how GPT Engineer can be used to generate code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import openai\nopenai.api_key = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;\n\ndef generate_code(prompt):\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine=&quot;text-davinci-002&quot;,\n        prompt=prompt,\n        max_tokens=1024,\n        n=1,\n        stop=None,\n        temperature=0.5,\n    )\n    return response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\ncode = generate_code(&quot;Generate a function that returns the sum of two numbers&quot;)\nprint(code)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overall, GPT Engineer is a promising project for developers interested in AI programming tools. It provides a platform for experimentation and encourages community contributions to improve the project.</p>\n"}
