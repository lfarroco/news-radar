The website can be accessed through the following link: <code>http://fjc5nelrg72fcyn3qnuwzhaexdwg4f6ksrwt5ysninhhwz4zglb22uqd.onion/</code>. </p>\n<p>While the experiment was not necessarily related to programming languages or frameworks, it highlights the importance of security and privacy in web development. Developers should be aware of the potential risks and vulnerabilities in their applications, and take measures to protect sensitive information.</p>\n<p>In terms of Flask specifically, it is a popular micro web framework for Python. It allows developers to quickly build web applications with minimal boilerplate code. Flask is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a great choice for small to medium-sized projects.</p>\n<p>Developers can also take advantage of Flask&#39;s extensive ecosystem of extensions and libraries, which can add functionality such as authentication, database integration, and more.</p>\n<p>Overall, the experiment with deploying a Flask app on Tor serves as a reminder for developers to prioritize security and privacy in their web applications. By using frameworks like Flask and taking appropriate measures to protect sensitive information, developers can ensure that their applications are safe and secure for users.</p>\n"}
