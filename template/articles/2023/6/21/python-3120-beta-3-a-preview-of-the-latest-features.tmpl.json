The release is a preview of the major new features and changes that will be included in the upcoming Python 3.12 release.</p>\n<p>Python 3.12.0 beta 3 can be downloaded from the official Python website. The release includes several new features and changes that developers will find useful. Some of the major new features and changes in Python 3.12 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Structural Pattern Matching: This feature allows developers to match complex data structures in a concise and readable way. It is a powerful tool for working with data in Python.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Improved Error Messages: Python 3.12 includes improved error messages that make it easier for developers to identify and fix errors in their code.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Improved Performance: Python 3.12 includes several performance improvements that make it faster and more efficient than previous versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>New Modules: Python 3.12 includes several new modules, including the &quot;zoneinfo&quot; module for working with time zones, and the &quot;graphlib&quot; module for working with graphs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details on the changes to Python 3.12, see the official release notes on the Python website.</p>\n<p>Developers who want to try out the new features and changes in Python 3.12 can download the beta release and start experimenting. However, it is important to note that beta releases are not stable and may contain bugs or other issues. It is recommended that developers do not use beta releases in production environments.</p>\n<p>Python 3.12.0 beta 3 is the last beta release before the final release of Python 3.12. The next pre-release of Python 3.12 will be 3.12.0b4, which is currently scheduled for July 10, 2023.</p>\n<p>Python continues to be a popular language for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis to machine learning. With the release of Python 3.12, developers have even more tools and features at their disposal to build powerful and efficient applications.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use the new Structural Pattern Matching feature in Python 3.12:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">data = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30}\n\nmatch data:\n    case {&quot;name&quot;: str(name), &quot;age&quot;: int(age)}:\n        print(f&quot;Name: {name}, Age: {age}&quot;)\n    case _:\n        print(&quot;Invalid data&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code matches the &quot;data&quot; dictionary against a pattern that includes a string &quot;name&quot; and an integer &quot;age&quot;. If the pattern matches, the code prints the name and age. If the pattern does not match, the code prints &quot;Invalid data&quot;. This is just one example of the many ways that Structural Pattern Matching can be used in Python 3.12.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Python 3.12.0 beta 3 is an exciting preview of the new features and changes that will be included in the upcoming Python 3.12 release. Developers who want to stay up-to-date with the latest news and information on Python should follow the official Python website and community.</p>\n"}
