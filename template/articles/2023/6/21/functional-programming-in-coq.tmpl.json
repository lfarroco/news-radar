It is based on the calculus of inductive constructions and supports functional programming. In this article, we will explore the basics of functional programming in Coq.</p>\n<p>Introduction\nCoq is a dependently typed programming language that supports functional programming. It is used for formal verification of software and hardware systems. Coq&#39;s type system allows developers to write programs that are guaranteed to be correct. Coq&#39;s proof assistant can be used to prove the correctness of the programs.</p>\n<p>Data and Functions\nIn Coq, data types and functions are defined using the keyword &quot;Inductive&quot;. For example, we can define a data type for the days of the week as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>Inductive day : Type :=\n  | Monday\n  | Tuesday\n  | Wednesday\n  | Thursday\n  | Friday\n  | Saturday\n  | Sunday.\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can define functions on this data type using pattern matching. For example, we can define a function that returns true if a given day is a weekday:</p>\n<pre><code>Definition isWeekday (d : day) : bool :=\n  match d with\n  | Monday =&gt; true\n  | Tuesday =&gt; true\n  | Wednesday =&gt; true\n  | Thursday =&gt; true\n  | Friday =&gt; true\n  | _ =&gt; false\n  end.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Enumerated Types\nCoq supports enumerated types, which are data types with a fixed number of values. For example, we can define a boolean data type as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>Inductive bool : Type :=\n  | true\n  | false.\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can define functions on this data type using pattern matching. For example, we can define a function that implements the logical &quot;and&quot; operation:</p>\n<pre><code>Definition andb (b1 : bool) (b2 : bool) : bool :=\n  match b1 with\n  | true =&gt; b2\n  | false =&gt; false\n  end.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Modules\nCoq supports modules, which are used to organize code into separate namespaces. Modules can be used to define data types, functions, and theorems. For example, we can define a module that contains functions for working with tuples:</p>\n<pre><code>Module Tuple.\n\nInductive tuple (A B : Type) : Type :=\n  | pair : A -&gt; B -&gt; tuple A B.\n\nDefinition fst {A B : Type} (p : tuple A B) : A :=\n  match p with\n  | pair x y =&gt; x\n  end.\n\nDefinition snd {A B : Type} (p : tuple A B) : B :=\n  match p with\n  | pair x y =&gt; y\n  end.\n\nEnd Tuple.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Tuples\nWe can define a data type for tuples using the &quot;Inductive&quot; keyword. We can define functions for working with tuples using pattern matching. For example, we can define functions for getting the first and second elements of a tuple using the &quot;fst&quot; and &quot;snd&quot; functions from the &quot;Tuple&quot; module.</p>\n<p>Numbers\nCoq supports natural numbers, which are defined using the &quot;Inductive&quot; keyword. We can define functions for working with natural numbers using pattern matching. For example, we can define a function for computing the factorial of a number:</p>\n<pre><code>Fixpoint factorial (n : nat) : nat :=\n  match n with\n  | O =&gt; 1\n  | S n&#39; =&gt; n * factorial n&#39;\n  end.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Proof by Simplification\nCoq supports proof by simplification, which involves simplifying expressions using rewriting rules. For example, we can prove the following theorem using proof by simplification:</p>\n<pre><code>Theorem plus_id_exercise : forall n m : nat,\n  n = m -&gt;\n  n + m = m + n.\nProof.\n  intros n m H.\n  rewrite -&gt; H.\n  reflexivity.\nQed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Proof by Rewriting\nCoq supports proof by rewriting, which involves rewriting expressions using equality rules. For example, we can prove the following theorem using proof by rewriting:</p>\n<pre><code>Theorem mult_n_1 : forall n : nat,\n  n * 1 = n.\nProof.\n  intros n.\n  rewrite &lt;- mult_1_l.\n  reflexivity.\nQed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Conclusion\nCoq is a powerful tool for functional programming and formal verification. It supports data types, functions, modules, and proof techniques such as proof by simplification and proof by rewriting. Coq&#39;s type system allows developers to write programs that are guaranteed to be correct.</p>\n"}
