Dev Mode aims to provide developers with the necessary tools to improve collaboration and efficiency in product development. Figma&#39;s unconventional start as a web-based design tool has allowed designers to collaborate on in-progress work, sharing early explorations, rather than safeguarding designs until they felt &quot;polished.&quot; As Figma&#39;s popularity grew, so did the number of developers using the tool. Today, more developers visit Figma than designers on paid plans. </p>\n<p>Dev Mode is a workspace that harnesses the tools developers use every day. It offers unique workflows and preferences for front-end developers working with mature design systems, design systems engineers building components, and those building content layouts and exporting assets in their work with brand designers. Dev Mode also provides developers with access to Figma&#39;s API, allowing them to automate repetitive tasks and integrate Figma with other tools in their workflow. </p>\n<p>Figma&#39;s focus on developers&#39; needs and challenges is critical to making the tool a more efficient, collaborative, and expressive place for product development. With Dev Mode, Figma hopes to improve collaboration between designers and developers and make the tool more accessible to developers. </p>\n<p>Developers can access Dev Mode by clicking on the &quot;Dev Mode&quot; button in the top right corner of the Figma interface. From there, they can access a range of tools and features tailored to their specific needs. </p>\n<p>Overall, Dev Mode is a significant step forward for Figma in catering to developers&#39; needs. By providing a workspace that harnesses the tools developers use every day, Figma hopes to improve collaboration and efficiency in product development.</p>\n"}
