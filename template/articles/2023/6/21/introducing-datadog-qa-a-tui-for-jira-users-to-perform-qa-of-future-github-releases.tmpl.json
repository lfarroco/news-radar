This tool is designed to help QA managers perform QA on future GitHub releases. Datadog QA is a TUI (Text User Interface) for Jira users that allows them to perform QA on future GitHub releases.</p>\n<p>With Datadog QA, QA managers can easily manage their QA process by creating test cases, assigning test cases to team members, and tracking the status of each test case. The tool also allows QA managers to view the status of each GitHub release and track any issues that have been identified.</p>\n<p>Datadog QA is built using Python and is available under the MIT license. The tool has already gained popularity among developers due to its ease of use and powerful features.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use Datadog QA to create a new test case:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from ddqa import Jira, TestPlan\n\njira = Jira(&quot;https://mycompany.atlassian.net&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)\ntest_plan = TestPlan(jira, &quot;PROJ&quot;, &quot;Test Plan Name&quot;)\n\ntest_case = test_plan.create_test_case(&quot;Test Case Name&quot;)\ntest_case.add_step(&quot;Step 1&quot;, &quot;Expected Result 1&quot;)\ntest_case.add_step(&quot;Step 2&quot;, &quot;Expected Result 2&quot;)\ntest_case.save()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overall, Datadog QA is a powerful tool that can help QA managers streamline their QA process and ensure that future GitHub releases are thoroughly tested before they are released to the public.</p>\n"}
