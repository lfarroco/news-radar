The author draws on their experience managing memory in large code bases and highlights the issues with using smart pointers, such as memory fragmentation and fake memory leaks.</p>\n<p>Index handles, according to the author, are a better alternative to pointers because they allow for faster and more efficient memory management. They work by using an index to reference an object in memory, rather than a pointer to the object itself. This approach reduces the number of heap allocations needed and can improve cache performance.</p>\n<p>The author also addresses the issue of handle collisions, where two objects are assigned the same handle index. To prevent this, the author suggests using a per-slot generation counter to ensure that each handle index is unique.</p>\n<p>For developers looking to optimize their code, index handles offer a promising solution to memory management. The author provides code examples to demonstrate how index handles can be implemented in C and C++.</p>\n<p>Overall, this article provides valuable insights into dynamic memory management and highlights the benefits of using index handles over traditional pointers. As the programming industry continues to evolve, it is important for developers to stay up-to-date with the latest techniques and tools to optimize their code.</p>\n"}
