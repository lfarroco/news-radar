The website is designed to make achievement hunting easier and more enjoyable for gamers.</p>\n<p>The website&#39;s creator has open-sourced all of the code on GitHub, inviting other developers to provide feedback and use the code in their own projects. The website&#39;s features include a summary of a user&#39;s achievements, an easy-to-use search function, and a discussion forum for each achievement.</p>\n<p>The website&#39;s frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Flask, a Python-based web framework. The website also uses SQLite as its database management system.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use Flask to create a simple web application:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(&#39;/&#39;)\ndef index():\n    return render_template(&#39;index.html&#39;)\n\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\n    app.run(debug=True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, Flask is used to create a simple web application that renders an HTML template when the user visits the root URL. The <code>render_template</code> function is used to render the HTML template, which can include variables that are passed in from the Python code.</p>\n<p>StatsForSteam is a great example of how Flask can be used to create a powerful web application that meets the needs of a specific user base. As more and more gamers turn to online platforms to track their achievements and connect with other players, Flask-based websites like StatsForSteam are likely to become increasingly popular.</p>\n"}
