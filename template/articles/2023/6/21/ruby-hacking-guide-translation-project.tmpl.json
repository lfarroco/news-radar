Each part covers a different aspect of the language, from the basics of objects and classes to advanced topics like garbage collection and debugging.</p>\n<p>The translation project is hosted on RubyForge, and the source code and tools used in the book can be downloaded from the project&#39;s official support site. The project is in open review, so readers are encouraged to address any issues they find.</p>\n<p>Ruby is a popular programming language used for web development, scripting, and other applications. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a great language for beginners to learn. The Ruby community is active and supportive, with many resources available for developers to learn and improve their skills.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a Ruby code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">def fibonacci(n)\n  return n if n &lt;= 1\n  fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\nend\n\nputs fibonacci(10) # prints 55\n</code></pre>\n<p>Overall, the Ruby Hacking Guide Translation Project is a valuable resource for developers looking to learn more about the Ruby programming language.</p>\n"}
