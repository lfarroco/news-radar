There are also a good number of macOS-specific command-line utilities that provide unique macOS functionality. To view the full documentation for any of these commands, run <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>One of these tools is <code>caffeinate</code>, which can be used to set Mac sleep behavior. Running <code>caffeinate</code> with no flags or arguments prevents your Mac from going to sleep as long as the command continues to run. Adding the <code>-u -t &lt;seconds&gt;</code> flags also prevents sleep for the specified number of seconds. Specifying an existing process with <code>-w &lt;pid&gt;</code> automatically exits the <code>caffeinate</code> command once the specified process exits. Passing a command with <code>caffeinate &lt;command&gt;</code> starts the given command in a new process and will prevent sleep until that process exits.</p>\n<p>Another useful tool is <code>textutil</code>, which can convert files to and from Microsoft Word, plain text, rich text, and HTML formats. For example, <code>textutil -convert html journal.doc</code> converts <code>journal.doc</code> into <code>journal.html</code>. The possible values for <code>-convert</code> are: <code>txt</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>rtf</code>, <code>rtfd</code>, <code>doc</code>, <code>docx</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally, <code>mdfind</code> can be used to search with Spotlight. <code>mdfind &lt;query&gt;</code> performs a keyword-based Spotlight search with the given query. <code>mdfind kMDItemAppStoreHasReceipt=1</code> finds all apps installed from the Mac App Store. <code>mdfind -name &lt;name&gt;</code> searches for all files matching the given name.</p>\n<p>These command-line tools can save developers time and effort by providing quick access to unique macOS functionality.</p>\n"}
