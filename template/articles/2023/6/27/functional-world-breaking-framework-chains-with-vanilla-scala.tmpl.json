The event will take place on June 28 at 6 pm CEST and will feature a discussion on a minimalist approach to web application development using independent libraries in Scala. Attendees will also learn about the power of Vanilla Scala and how to push beyond framework boundaries. </p>\n<p>The event will explore libraries such as Jsoniter-Scala, Chimney, MacWire, Sttp, Diffx, and Dijon and how they can augment the development process. The discussion will delve into a streamlined approach while respecting the role of frameworks and demonstrate how simplicity can empower developers to exceed expectations. </p>\n<p>For developers interested in attending, registration is required and can be done through the Scalac website. The event is also an opportunity to join the Meetup group and stay up to date with future events. </p>\n<p>Scala is a general-purpose programming language that combines object-oriented programming with functional programming. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine and can be used to build web applications, data processing systems, and more. With the rise of functional programming, Scala has become a popular choice for developers looking to write concise and expressive code. </p>\n<p>Developers looking to keep up with the latest news in the industry can follow Dev Radar for updates on programming languages, frameworks, and more.</p>\n"}
