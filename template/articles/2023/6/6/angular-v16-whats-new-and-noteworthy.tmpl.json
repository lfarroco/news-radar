In this article, we will take a closer look at the new features and changes introduced in this version.</p>\n<p>Minko Gechev, a Google engineer and Angular team member, summarizes the most important new features in his release announcement. One of the most notable changes is the introduction of fine-grained change detection, which allows developers to optimize the performance of their applications by selectively updating only the components that have changed.</p>\n<p>Another major feature is the introduction of Signals and SignalStore, a new state management solution that has a similar approach to @ngrx/component-store. The NgRx team and Marko StanimiroviÄ‡ opened a new RFC (Request for Comments) for this new feature, and the initial prototype alongside with the API documentation is available in the NgRx SignalStore playground repo.</p>\n<p>To help developers get started with these new features, the author of the article has created two resources: a Signals Study Guide and a Master Angular 16 article that lists out the most important changes and new features, and collects resources that will teach you how these new Angular features work.</p>\n<p>In addition to these major changes, Angular v16 also includes several other improvements and bug fixes. For example, the Angular team has improved the performance of the Ivy renderer, added support for TypeScript 4.5, and made it easier to use Angular with Webpack 5.</p>\n<p>For developers who are upgrading from an earlier version of Angular, there are a few breaking changes to be aware of. For example, the deprecated ViewEncapsulation.Native option has been removed, and the deprecated Renderer2 class has been replaced by the Renderer3 class.</p>\n<p>Overall, Angular v16 is a significant update that introduces several new features and improvements. As always, it&#39;s important for developers to stay up-to-date with the latest changes in the industry, and this new version of Angular is no exception. Whether you are a seasoned Angular developer or just getting started, there are plenty of resources available to help you learn and master these new features.</p>\n"}
