As computing power becomes increasingly limited on embedded devices, the implementation of image processing algorithms in programming languages like C has become more important than ever. In this article, we will provide an overview of modern image processing algorithms and their implementation in C.</p>\n<p>To implement modern image processing algorithms in C, developers must have a solid understanding of image representation, data structures, and algorithmic concepts. Uncompressed image data is typically stored as matrices or multidimensional arrays, with each element representing a pixel&#39;s intensity or color value. C provides the necessary tools to access and manipulate individual pixels efficiently, making it an ideal language for algorithm implementation.</p>\n<p>While there are many image processing algorithms available, we will focus on a few key ones. The Hough Transform algorithm is used to detect lines in an image, while Skeletonization is used to reduce the thickness of objects in an image. These algorithms, when used together, can provide powerful image processing capabilities.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s worth noting that a machine learning approach is not always the best or first solution to solve common Computer Vision problems. Standard image processing algorithms such as the ones mentioned above can be just as effective, if not more so, when used properly.</p>\n<p>For those interested in implementing these algorithms in C, the open-source, embedded computer vision library SOD already includes most of them, with the exception of the patented SIFT &amp; SURF algorithms. SOD is already in production use at PixLab and FACEIO.</p>\n<p>To give developers a better understanding of how these algorithms work, we have included some sample code snippets below:</p>\n<p>// Hough Transform Algorithm\nfor (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) {\n    for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) {\n        if (image[y][x] == 255) {\n            for (int theta = 0; theta &lt; 180; theta++) {\n                int r = (int)(x * cos(theta) + y * sin(theta));\n                accumulator[r + 90][theta]++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}</p>\n<p>// Skeletonization Algorithm\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++) {\n    for (int y = 1; y &lt; height - 1; y++) {\n        for (int x = 1; x &lt; width - 1; x++) {\n            int p2 = image[y - 1][x];\n            int p3 = image[y - 1][x + 1];\n            int p4 = image[y][x + 1];\n            int p5 = image[y + 1][x + 1];\n            int p6 = image[y + 1][x];\n            int p7 = image[y + 1][x - 1];\n            int p8 = image[y][x - 1];\n            int p9 = image[y - 1][x - 1];\n            int A = (p2 == 0 &amp;&amp; p3 == 1) + (p3 == 0 &amp;&amp; p4 == 1) +\n                    (p4 == 0 &amp;&amp; p5 == 1) + (p5 == 0 &amp;&amp; p6 == 1) +\n                    (p6 == 0 &amp;&amp; p7 == 1) + (p7 == 0 &amp;&amp; p8 == 1) +\n                    (p8 == 0 &amp;&amp; p9 == 1) + (p9 == 0 &amp;&amp; p2 == 1);\n            int B = p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 + p9;\n            int m1 = i == 0 ? (p2 * p4 * p6) : (p2 * p4 * p8);\n            int m2 = i == 0 ? (p4 * p6 * p8) : (p2 * p6 * p8);\n            if (A == 1 &amp;&amp; (B &gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; B &lt;= 6) &amp;&amp; m1 == 0 &amp;&amp; m2 == 0) {\n                skeletonized[y][x] = 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}</p>\n<p>In conclusion, implementing modern image processing algorithms in C can provide developers with efficient and optimized solutions, especially on embedded devices. By using standard image processing algorithms like the Hough Transform and Skeletonization, developers can achieve powerful image processing capabilities without relying on machine learning.</p>\n"}
