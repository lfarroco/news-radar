The article begins with an introduction to Hypersistence Optimizer, a tool that can automatically detect JPA and Hibernate performance issues. The author then explains the importance of validating the DDL schema and JPA entity mappings and provides a solution to do so using Spring and Hibernate.</p>\n<p>The article highlights the hbm2ddl validate strategy provided by Hibernate. This strategy can be used to manage or validate the underlying database schema. However, it is best to use an automatic schema management tool like Flyway to manage the database schema. The author also recommends setting the value of spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate to check that Flyway generated tables and entities are in sync.</p>\n<p>The article provides code snippets to demonstrate how to validate the DDL schema using Spring and Hibernate. The author also explains how to use the Hibernate SchemaManagementTool to generate DDL scripts to determine the database schema that Hibernate expects for the current JPA entity mappings.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the article provides a comprehensive guide on how to validate the DDL schema and JPA entity mappings using Spring and Hibernate. The author emphasizes the importance of using automatic schema management tools like Flyway and provides code snippets to help developers implement the solution.
