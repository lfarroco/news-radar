In order to reach a wider audience, it&#39;s crucial to make content understandable in other languages, regions, and cultures. But why is i18n so important? The answer is simple: we live in an era where hundreds of cultures interact with each other every day, and our current internet doesn&#39;t satisfy its globalized needs.</p>\n<p>As developers, we must adapt our sites to support translations and formats for other countries, languages, and dialects. Fortunately, in the case of Gatsby and other static site generators, translations don&#39;t bloat up the page bundle size since they are delivered as part of the static page. However, there are still challenges when implementing i18n on our sites.</p>\n<p>One of the main challenges is choosing the right plugins and libraries to address the problems that arise when implementing i18n. But with so many options available, it can be difficult to choose the right one. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to stay up-to-date with the latest news and developments in the i18n space.</p>\n<p>For developers looking to keep up with the latest i18n news, Dev Radar is the perfect resource.
