However, sometimes Python&#39;s performance can be a bottleneck, especially when dealing with computationally intensive tasks. One way to overcome this limitation is to write native Python extensions in Rust, a fast and memory-safe programming language.</p>\n<p>PyO3 is a Rust library that provides a seamless interface between Rust and Python, allowing developers to write Python extensions in Rust. PyO3 takes care of the low-level details, such as memory management and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), so that developers can focus on writing optimized and safe code.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will explore how to document native Python extensions made with Rust and PyO3. Documentation is an essential part of software development, as it helps users understand how to use the software and its API. Without proper documentation, users may struggle to use the software, leading to frustration and wasted time.</p>\n<p>The author of this article, Ivan Kud, shares his experience of using PyO3 extensively in his software projects, including Similari, FFmpeg-Rust, and Savant-Rs modules. He highlights the benefits of using Rust for Python extensions, such as improved performance and memory safety.</p>\n<p>However, documenting Rust-based Python extensions can be challenging, especially when dealing with large APIs. The author initially used a markdown file to document his extensions, but this approach was not scalable for large APIs. To address this issue, the author developed a tool called rustdoc-pyo3, which generates Python-style documentation for Rust-based Python extensions.</p>\n<p>Rustdoc-pyo3 is a command-line tool that takes a Rust crate as input and generates a Python-style documentation in HTML format. The tool uses Rust&#39;s built-in documentation system, Rustdoc, to extract the documentation comments from the Rust code and converts them into Python-style documentation. The resulting documentation includes information about the module, functions, structs, enums, and traits, as well as their parameters and return types.</p>\n<p>The author provides an example of how to use rustdoc-pyo3 to generate documentation for a Rust-based Python extension. He also highlights some of the limitations of the tool, such as the lack of support for generating documentation for Python-specific features, such as decorators and type annotations.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Rust and PyO3 provide a powerful combination for writing fast and memory-safe Python extensions. However, documenting these extensions can be challenging, especially for large APIs. Rustdoc-pyo3 is a useful tool for generating Python-style documentation for Rust-based Python extensions, but it has some limitations. As always, proper documentation is essential for creating usable and maintainable software.</p>\n"}
