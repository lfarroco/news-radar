The tutorial covers the basics of Flask and SQLAlchemy, as well as more advanced topics such as database migrations, querying, and relationships.</p>\n<p>The tutorial begins by introducing Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. It then goes on to explain how to use SQLAlchemy, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, with Flask to interact with a database.</p>\n<p>The tutorial provides code snippets throughout, making it easy for developers to follow along and implement the concepts themselves. For example, it shows how to create a Flask application and connect it to a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = &#39;sqlite:///example.db&#39;\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The tutorial also covers more advanced topics, such as how to perform database migrations using Flask-Migrate and how to define relationships between database tables using SQLAlchemy&#39;s ORM.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Flask SQLAlchemy Tutorial is a valuable resource for developers who want to learn how to use Flask and SQLAlchemy together. It provides clear explanations and practical examples that make it easy to get started with these powerful tools.</p>\n"}
