{"layout":"article.njk","title":"Redux 5.0.0-beta.0 released","date":"2023-05-30T03:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2023-5-30","source_link":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta.0","tags":["programming-languages","frameworks","redux","javascript"],"topics":[{"name":"Programming Languages","slug":"programming-languages"},{"name":"Frameworks","slug":"frameworks"},{"name":"Redux","slug":"redux"},{"name":"JavaScript","slug":"javascript"}],"content":"<p>The beta release of Redux 5.0.0 includes a new UnknownAction type for better type safety in TypeScript, along with all prior changes from the 5.0 alphas. This release has breaking changes from version 4.x, so users are recommended to use Redux Toolkit for Redux development and the RTK 2.0 beta that depends on this core release, instead of using the Redux core library directly.</p>\n<p>The new UnknownAction type treats all fields other than action.type as unknown, providing more meaningful type safety for developers. This encourages users to write type guards that check the action object and assert its specific TypeScript.</p>\n<p>To install the beta release, users can use the following commands:</p>\n<pre><code>npm i redux@next\nyarn add redux@next\n</code></pre>\n<p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, which helps manage the state of an application in a single immutable store. It has become a popular choice for managing state in React applications, along with other front-end frameworks.</p>\n<p>As Redux 5.0.0 is still in beta, developers should be cautious when using it in production environments. However, the new UnknownAction type and improved type safety make it an exciting release for developers to test and experiment with.</p>\n"}
