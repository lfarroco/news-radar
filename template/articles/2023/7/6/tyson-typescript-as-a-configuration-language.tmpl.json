Unlike other solutions that rely on Node or V8, TySON is a native Go library that generates JSON. It combines the simplicity of JSON with the flexibility of TypeScript syntax, including comments, types, and basic logic.</p>\n<p>One of the key benefits of TySON is its type safety. By leveraging TypeScript&#39;s type system, developers can ensure that their configuration is valid and avoid common errors. Additionally, TySON supports programmability, allowing developers to generate configuration programmatically and import and override values.</p>\n<p>Another advantage of TySON is its familiar syntax. Since it is a subset of TypeScript, developers who are already familiar with the language can easily work with TySON. Editors also provide support for TySON out of the box, including syntax highlighting, formatting, and auto-completion.</p>\n<p>In the past, developers have relied on JSON, YAML, or TOML for configuration. However, each of these options has its drawbacks, such as lack of type safety or limited programmability. TySON aims to address these issues and provide a more robust and flexible solution for configuration needs.</p>\n<p>To get started with TySON, developers can use the provided Go library, and a Rust implementation is in the works. With TySON, developers can take their configuration to the next level by leveraging the power of TypeScript and ensuring the reliability and flexibility of their applications.</p>\n"}
