One of the reasons for its success is its exceptional documentation.</p>\n<p>Unlike many other programming languages, Elixir&#39;s documentation is not only easy to navigate but also includes extensive discussion, guides, and examples. For example, if you want to learn about the Map data structure in Elixir, the official documentation provides almost two pages of detailed information, including usage, warnings, and numerous examples.</p>\n<p>But what sets Elixir&#39;s documentation apart is the inclusion of doctests. These are examples that not only demonstrate how to use a particular function but also serve as executable tests. This means that you can be confident that the examples provided in the documentation actually work.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Elixir&#39;s documentation is hosted on HexDocs, a valuable resource for Elixir developers. HexDocs not only provides online documentation but also allows developers to review code changes between different versions of a library. This feature enables developers to easily assess the impact of upgrading to a new version.</p>\n<p>In summary, Elixir&#39;s documentation is a developer&#39;s dream. It provides comprehensive information, extensive examples, and the ability to review code changes. Whether you are new to Elixir or an experienced developer, the documentation will undoubtedly enhance your programming experience.</p>\n<p>To get started with Elixir, check out Fly.io, a platform that specializes in running Phoenix applications.
