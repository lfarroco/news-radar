In this guide, you will learn how to install Tailwind CSS with Angular and integrate the open-source UI components from the Flowbite Library.</p>\n<p>To get started, install the official Angular CLI tool by running the following command in your terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g @angular/cli\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, create a new Angular project by running:</p>\n<pre><code>ng new my-app --style=css\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the project is created, navigate to the project folder and install Tailwind CSS:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install tailwindcss\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, install the Flowbite Library:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install flowbite\n</code></pre>\n<p>With all the frameworks and libraries installed, you can now start using the UI components from Flowbite. For example, you can add a modal component to your app.component.html file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;fb-modal title=&quot;Example Modal&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;fb-modal-body&gt;\n    This is the content of the modal.\n  &lt;/fb-modal-body&gt;\n  &lt;fb-modal-footer&gt;\n    &lt;button fbButton&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/fb-modal-footer&gt;\n&lt;/fb-modal&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>By following these steps, you can easily set up Angular with Tailwind CSS and leverage the interactive UI components from the Flowbite Library to build enterprise-level web applications.
