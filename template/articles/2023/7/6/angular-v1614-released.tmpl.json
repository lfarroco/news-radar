This update brings several bug fixes and improvements to the core and upgrade modules.</p>\n<p>In the core module, one of the notable changes is the use of <code>setTimeout</code> when coalescing tasks in Node.js. This enhancement addresses an issue where tasks were not properly coalesced, leading to performance degradation. Developers can now expect better task coalescing and improved performance when using Angular with Node.js.</p>\n<p>The upgrade module also received attention in this release. A fix was implemented to allow downgraded components to work seamlessly with the component-router. This improvement ensures that developers can easily downgrade components and still utilize the component-router functionality without any issues.</p>\n<p>Overall, Angular v16.1.4 brings important bug fixes and enhancements to the framework, making it more reliable and efficient for developers. To upgrade to the latest version, developers can refer to the official Angular documentation and follow the recommended upgrade process.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Example code snippet using Angular v16.1.4\nimport { Component } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\n\n@Component({\n  selector: &#39;app-root&#39;,\n  template: `\n    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Angular v16.1.4&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Upgrade your web development experience with the latest version!&lt;/p&gt;\n  `\n})\nexport class AppComponent {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates and news from the Angular community in future releases of Dev Radar magazine.</p>\n"}
