In this progress report, the author highlights recent developments, including fixing compilation errors and adding support for the cold function attribute. They also mention working on Link-Time Optimization (LTO) support, which showed a significant performance improvement of around 40% for both GCC and LLVM. Additionally, the author created a wiki page to track successful compilation of Rust code on new platforms. The report concludes with a summary of implemented features and a link to the UI test results. Developers interested in contributing to rustc_codegen_gcc are encouraged to run the tests locally.</p>\n"}
