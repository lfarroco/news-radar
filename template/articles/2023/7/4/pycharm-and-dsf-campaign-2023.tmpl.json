This campaign offers developers a 30% discount on a year of PyCharm, with 100% of the proceeds going to the DSF. Additionally, purchasers will receive one free month of access to JetBrains Academy, which offers courses on topics like Django, SQL, and Git.</p>\n<p>The DSF relies on donations like this to continue its operations. The funds raised through the PyCharm fundraiser have historically accounted for a significant portion of the DSF&#39;s budget. In 2022, the DSF&#39;s Fellows played a crucial role in maintaining and improving Django.</p>\n<p>In addition to financial support, the DSF also provides assistance to Django groups worldwide, sponsoring DjangoCons and smaller events like DjangoGirls. This commitment to fostering the Django community is an essential part of the DSF&#39;s mission.</p>\n<p>By participating in the PyCharm &amp; DSF Campaign 2023, developers not only gain access to a powerful IDE but also contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Django ecosystem. Don&#39;t miss out on this opportunity to support Django while enhancing your Python development experience.</p>\n"}
