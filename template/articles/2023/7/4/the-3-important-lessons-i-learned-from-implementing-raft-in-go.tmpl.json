The Raft algorithm is a distributed consensus protocol that allows a group of nodes to work together as a single coordinated group. </p>\n<p>The author highlights three important lessons they learned during the implementation process. First, they emphasize the significance of understanding the problem domain thoroughly before starting the implementation. Second, they stress the importance of writing clean and maintainable code, which can greatly simplify the debugging and testing process. Lastly, they discuss the benefits of using existing libraries and frameworks to leverage the work of others and speed up development.</p>\n<p>The article provides valuable insights for developers interested in distributed systems and consensus algorithms.</p>\n"}
