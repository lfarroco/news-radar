In an Nx project, combining coverage from different testing techniques, such as Cypress (E2E and component tests) and Jest, can provide a comprehensive picture of the tested code. This article by Christian LÃ¼demann explains how to set up coverage for Jest tests, as well as Cypress component tests, and merge the coverage results into one report.</p>\n<p>To enable coverage for Jest tests, simply configure the Jest properties in the project&#39;s configuration file. Running <code>nx test</code> will generate the coverage files automatically.</p>\n<p>For Cypress component tests, manual configuration is required. A custom webpack configuration using the <code>@jsdevtools/coverage-istanbul-loader</code> loader is needed. The article provides a sample webpack config that can be used with the <code>@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser</code> builder.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <code>@cypress/code-coverage</code> package is used to generate coverage reports for Cypress tests. By adding a few lines of code to the component and Cypress configuration files, developers can run component tests and generate coverage reports.</p>\n<p>By following the steps outlined in this article, developers can combine coverage from Cypress and Jest in an Nx project, providing a comprehensive view of their test coverage.</p>\n"}
