With this innovative tool, developers can run Node.js code directly in their browsers, without the need for a local installation.</p>\n<p>Although the project is not yet stable, it shows great potential for developers seeking to experiment with Node.js in a browser environment. The current version utilizes the Alpine Linux emulator, which takes approximately 14 seconds to start the Node.js runtime. However, the developer is actively working on optimizing the project for better performance.</p>\n<p>In terms of alternatives, the project also mentions container2wasm, another option for running Node.js in the browser. However, it currently suffers from performance issues, taking around 16 seconds to start.</p>\n<p>Developers interested in trying out Node on Web can access the library deployed with GitHub Pages for testing purposes. Please note that this process may take longer depending on your internet connection, as approximately 70 MB will be downloaded.</p>\n<p>For more information and updates on the project, including its current status and issues, developers can refer to the GitHub repository. The project&#39;s license, stars, watchers, forks, and supported languages can also be found there.</p>\n<p>Node on Web opens up exciting possibilities for developers, allowing them to explore Node.js in a browser environment and experiment with new ideas. Stay tuned for further updates and improvements as the project progresses.</p>\n"}
