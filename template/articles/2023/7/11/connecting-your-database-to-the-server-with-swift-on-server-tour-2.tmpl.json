The article focuses on designing the data model for posts in a microblog system and using PostgreSQL as the database to store the content. </p>\n<p>The author starts by explaining the process of designing the post data model. They emphasize the importance of adding a unique ID to each record in order to refer to specific posts accurately. The article then introduces a class in Swift to represent the data structure of the post.</p>\n<p>Next, the author discusses how to integrate the Post data type with Vapor, a popular web framework for Swift. They explain that Vapor uses Fluent, an Object-relational mapping (ORM) tool, to communicate with the database. The author provides step-by-step instructions on how to write the Post model in Vapor and configure the dependencies.</p>\n<p>To set up the PostgreSQL database, the author suggests using Docker, a lightweight containerization technology. They explain that Docker simplifies the installation process by bundling the necessary runtime into a sandbox environment. The article includes instructions on writing a docker-compose.yml file to start the database service.</p>\n<p>Overall, this article provides developers with a comprehensive guide on connecting a database to a server using Swift and Vapor. The step-by-step instructions and code snippets make it easy for developers to follow along and implement the concepts in their own projects.</p>\n"}
