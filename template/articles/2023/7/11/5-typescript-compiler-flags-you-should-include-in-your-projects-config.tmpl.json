However, amidst these changes, the release notes highlight some new compiler options that can greatly enhance your development experience.</p>\n<p>One such option is <code>noImplicitOverride</code>, which is particularly useful when working with inheritance. Enabling this flag ensures that the compiler warns you if a method in a child class is not properly overridden from the base class.</p>\n<p>Another flag, <code>noUncheckedIndexedAccess</code>, helps you handle objects with indefinite keys. By setting this flag to true, the compiler reminds you to check the validity of unknown properties before accessing them.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <code>noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature</code> flag promotes style consistency when working with object properties.</p>\n<p>Including these compiler flags in your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file can significantly improve your development workflow and help you catch potential errors early on.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">{\n  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\n    &quot;noImplicitOverride&quot;: true,\n    &quot;noUncheckedIndexedAccess&quot;: true,\n    &quot;noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature&quot;: true\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Stay up-to-date with the latest TypeScript features and make the most out of the language&#39;s capabilities.</p>\n"}
