In this article, the author shares their experience with TypeScript and how incorporating the Value Object pattern had an immediate impact on code quality.</p>\n<p>The Value Object pattern, introduced in Domain-Driven Design, allows developers to group attributes into a single unit that delivers specific behaviors. This unit represents a quality or quantity found in the real world and can be bound to more complex objects.</p>\n<p>In TypeScript, Value Objects can be represented as independent classes or by extending JavaScript native types. The goal is to provide additional behavior unique to that value or group of values. Additionally, Value Objects can provide specific methods for string formatting and support business invariants.</p>\n<p>By incorporating the Value Object pattern, developers can create more maintainable, testable, and stable code bases. This article provides code examples and references to further resources on the topic.</p>\n"}
