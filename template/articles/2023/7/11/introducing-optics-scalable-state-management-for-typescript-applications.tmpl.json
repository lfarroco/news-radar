With Optics, developers can easily read, update, and subscribe to any part of their global state, regardless of its nesting level. </p>\n<p>One of the key features of Optics is its ability to decompose the state using properties or methods, allowing developers to have full type-safety and code completion. This makes updating deeply nested values effortless and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.</p>\n<p>Optics also enables developers to decouple their components from the global state. By declaring optics in a component&#39;s props, developers can explicitly express their dependencies on external state. This not only improves the composability and testability of components but also makes them more maintainable.</p>\n<p>Another advantage of using Optics is the ability to compose state graphs. Instead of relying on plain ids and manual denormalization, Optics acts as references to other entities in the state. This allows developers to represent their state as a dynamic, type-safe, and reactive graph. When focusing on a specific part of the graph, Optics automatically denormalizes the value for easy access.</p>\n<p>With its focus on scalability, type-safety, and composability, Optics is a valuable addition to the toolkit of TypeScript developers. It simplifies state management and empowers developers to build robust and maintainable applications.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">// Example usage of Optics\nimport { Optic } from &#39;optics-ts&#39;;\n\n// Define the global state type\ntype GlobalState = {\n  user: {\n    id: number;\n    name: string;\n    email: string;\n  };\n  products: {\n    [id: number]: {\n      id: number;\n      name: string;\n      price: number;\n    };\n  };\n};\n\n// Create optics for specific parts of the state\nconst userOptic = Optic.from&lt;GlobalState&gt;().prop(&#39;user&#39;);\nconst userNameOptic = userOptic.prop(&#39;name&#39;);\nconst productsOptic = Optic.from&lt;GlobalState&gt;().prop(&#39;products&#39;);\nconst productOptic = (id: number) =&gt; productsOptic.prop(id);\n\n// Read the user&#39;s name from the global state\nconst userName = userNameOptic.get(globalState);\n\n// Update the user&#39;s name in the global state\nconst updatedState = userNameOptic.set(globalState, &#39;John Doe&#39;);\n\n// Subscribe to changes in the user&#39;s name\nuserNameOptic.subscribe(globalState, (newName) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`User&#39;s name changed to ${newName}`);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Optics offers a flexible and intuitive approach to state management, making it a valuable tool for TypeScript developers who want to keep up with the latest advancements in the industry.</p>\n"}
