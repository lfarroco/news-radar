It aims to overcome the limitations of Selenium and Puppeteer by offering a reliable and fast API. With Playwright, developers can write end-to-end test scripts that run smoothly on popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Not only does it support JavaScript and TypeScript, but it&#39;s also available for Python, Java, and .NET. Playwright is a cross-platform and cross-browser framework that allows developers to control browsers for automated tasks such as functional testing, API testing, web scraping, and bot automation.
