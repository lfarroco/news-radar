This release focuses on enhancements to the checkpointing system, which is crucial for production deployments. Checkpointing allows XTDB to scale out in a cluster and spin up new nodes quickly without replaying the transaction log from the start on every node. The release notes can be found on the XTDB GitHub repository. The XTDB team appreciates the valuable contributions from the community in designing and testing these enhancements. If you are already using checkpoints, the team would love to hear your feedback on the changes.</p>\n"}
