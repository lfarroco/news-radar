This preview release includes an early implementation of critical kernel features written in safe Rust. One notable feature is the new implementation of GDI region in win32kbase_rs.sys. Although this is a small trial, Microsoft plans to expand the usage of Rust in the Windows kernel. Developers can expect improved performance and fewer vulnerabilities in future Windows releases. Stay tuned for updates on Rust&#39;s integration and its impact on Windows development.</p>\n"}
