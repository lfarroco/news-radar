In this article, the author introduces the concept of optics and explores the world of optics using the Monocle library in Scala. The author starts by setting the stage with a problem: applying a 10% discount to the entire shop&#39;s prices. The article then walks through the solution using Monocle&#39;s optics manipulators. By using the <code>focus</code> and <code>modify</code> functions, the author demonstrates how to apply the discount to a single shelf and then to the entire shop. The article concludes by mentioning that there is much more functionality in Monocle to explore and provides links to the Monocle documentation and a code example.</p>\n"}
