With no external dependencies and a simple, readable configuration syntax, Xmake offers developers an efficient way to build projects directly or generate project files. </p>\n<p>One notable enhancement in this release is the improved support for Windows&#39; long path problem. Xmake now provides an installation option that allows users to selectively enable long path support, addressing the issue of nested projects failing when reading or writing files. Additionally, Xmake now supports OpenSUSE&#39;s zypper package manager, making it easier to download and install packages. </p>\n<p>Other improvements include enhanced msbuild package installation and improved protobuf support for grpc. Xmake has also introduced the ability to set library paths directly using the add_links feature, simplifying the process of finding and linking libraries.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Xmake and explore its new features, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n"}
