Despite its popularity, many developers only scratch the surface of its capabilities. In this two-part series, we&#39;ll take a deep dive into Devise.</p>\n<p>In this first part, we&#39;ll explore the basics of Devise, including its authentication features and how to install it in a Ruby on Rails 7 application. Devise is built on top of Warden, a Rack-based authentication framework, and provides controller actions, views, helpers, and configuration options for a complete user authentication solution.</p>\n<p>One notable feature of Devise is its modularity. It comes with around 10 modules that allow developers to customize authentication based on their specific needs. These modules include Registerable, Omniauthable, Trackable, and more.</p>\n<p>To get started with Devise, you can generate a new Rails 7 app and add the Devise gem to your Gemfile. Then, install Devise and generate a user model that Devise will work with. From there, you can progressively build more complex features and leverage Devise&#39;s powerful capabilities.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for part two of this series, where we&#39;ll explore advanced usages of Devise.</p>\n"}
