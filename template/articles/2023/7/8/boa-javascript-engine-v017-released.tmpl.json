This release is a major milestone for the project, with significant internal enhancements and new APIs. One of the standout features of this release is the introduction of a module system, which closely follows ECMAScript&#39;s Modules specification. The module system allows for customizable module loading, including the ability to load modules from multiple sources and fetch modules from URLs. Boa also includes a simple loader that covers most common use cases. Additionally, the release includes optimizations such as constant folding expression, which improves runtime efficiency and performance. Developers can check out the full list of changes and the project&#39;s conformance to ECMAScript versions on the Boa website.</p>\n"}
