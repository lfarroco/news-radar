However, there is a pressing issue that many TypeScript users face - the lack of runtime type information.</p>\n<p>In a recent article titled &quot;TypeScript please give us types,&quot; the author highlights the challenges developers encounter when dealing with serialization and validation without a reflective type system. The absence of runtime type information leads to excessive boilerplate code or the need for bespoke code generation from a schema file.</p>\n<p>The article emphasizes the importance of a type reflection model in the real world and urges the TypeScript team to consider this problem. It suggests that the team should prioritize tackling serialization and provide detailed documentation or recommendations for libraries that can address this issue.</p>\n<p>Developers have resorted to various workarounds, such as io-ts and zod, to handle serialization and validation. Some have even created new languages that extend TypeScript to overcome this limitation. However, these solutions are not ideal and often require developers to adopt unfamiliar approaches.</p>\n<p>To address this issue, the article calls for a holistic approach from the TypeScript team. It suggests listing out the challenges faced by TypeScript users in modern projects and prioritizing them. Specifically, the article emphasizes the need for a detailed documentation or official recommendations on how to handle serialization in TypeScript.</p>\n<p>As developers rely on TypeScript for its strong typing capabilities, it is crucial to provide them with the necessary tools and guidance to tackle this problem effectively. By addressing the issue of runtime type information, TypeScript can further solidify its position as a powerful language for building robust applications.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\">// Example code snippet demonstrating the need for runtime type information\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n\nconst serializedData = &#39;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;John Doe&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:25}&#39;;\nconst deserializedUser: User = JSON.parse(serializedData);\nconsole.log(deserializedUser.name); // Error: Property &#39;name&#39; does not exist on type &#39;unknown&#39;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In conclusion, the article sheds light on the need for runtime type information in TypeScript and urges the TypeScript team to prioritize addressing this issue. By providing developers with better support for serialization and validation, TypeScript can enhance its usability and empower developers to build more efficient and reliable applications.</p>\n"}
