It aims to provide a better alternative to regular expressions by offering a more readable, reusable, and performant solution for parsing text.</p>\n<p>Regular expressions can be difficult to debug and read, and they often perform poorly when dealing with large texts. KotlinSpirit addresses these issues by providing a simple library with compile-time expression checking.</p>\n<p>To get started with KotlinSpirit, you can add the following dependency to your build.gradle file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-groovy\">dependencies {\n    implementation &#39;com.example:kotlinspirit:1.0.0&#39;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have added the dependency, you can start creating parsers using the basic rules and operators provided by KotlinSpirit. The library consists of basic rules defined in the <code>Rules</code> object namespace.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s take a look at a simple example of creating a parser for a key-value pair, where the key is &quot;name&quot; and the value is &quot;age&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">import com.example.kotlinspirit.Rules.*\n\nval parser = sequence(\n    str(&quot;name=&quot;),\n    int(),\n    str(&quot;, age=&quot;),\n    int()\n)\n\nval input = &quot;name=John, age=30&quot;\nval result = parser.parse(input)\n\nif (result.isSuccess) {\n    val name = result.get(0)\n    val age = result.get(1)\n    println(&quot;Name: $name, Age: $age&quot;)\n} else {\n    println(&quot;Parsing failed&quot;)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, we use the <code>str</code> and <code>int</code> basic rules, along with the <code>sequence</code> operator and the <code>parse</code> function. The <code>parse</code> function checks if a string matches the parser from the beginning to the end. If the parsing is successful, we can retrieve the parsed values using the <code>get</code> function.</p>\n<p>KotlinSpirit also provides other useful parser functions and advanced features for handling more complex parsing scenarios. You can find more information and examples in the <a href=\"https://kotlinspirit.com/docs\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>With KotlinSpirit, developers can easily parse text in Kotlin without the limitations and complexities of regular expressions. It offers a more intuitive and efficient way to handle text parsing tasks, making it a valuable tool for developers working with Kotlin.</p>\n<p>Give KotlinSpirit a try and let us know what you think! Your feedback is important to us as we continue to improve and enhance the library.</p>\n"}
