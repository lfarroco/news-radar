With the potential to be the most impactful technology ever invented, superintelligence also poses significant risks. The goal of Superalignment is to ensure that AI systems, which are much smarter than humans, follow human intent and do not go rogue.</p>\n<p>Currently, our techniques for aligning AI rely on human supervision, which will not scale to superintelligence. To address this, Superalignment aims to build a roughly human-level automated alignment researcher. This will require developing a scalable training method, validating the resulting model, and stress testing the entire alignment pipeline.</p>\n<p>To achieve this ambitious goal, Superalignment has assembled a team of top machine learning researchers and engineers. They are dedicating 20% of their compute resources over the next four years to this effort. While success is not guaranteed, Superalignment believes that a focused and concerted effort can solve the core technical challenges of superintelligence alignment.</p>\n<p>Developers interested in keeping up with the latest news in AI and superintelligence alignment can follow Superalignment&#39;s progress and research priorities. Stay tuned for more updates on their roadmap and breakthroughs in this critical field.</p>\n"}
