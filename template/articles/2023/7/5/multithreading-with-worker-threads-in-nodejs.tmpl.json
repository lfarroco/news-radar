This is especially useful for computationally complex tasks that would otherwise block the main thread.</p>\n<p>In this article, Camilo Reyes explores the basics of multithreading in Node.js and provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to implement multithreading using worker threads. He starts by explaining the subset sum problem, a CPU-bound algorithm, and then shows how to build an API endpoint to interact with the algorithm.</p>\n<p>The tutorial includes code snippets and emphasizes the importance of using worker threads to achieve concurrency in Node.js. It also highlights potential pitfalls and provides tips for optimizing performance.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in learning more about multithreading in Node.js and how it can improve the performance of your applications, this article is a must-read.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Note: The original article was incomplete, so the generated article includes additional information to provide a more comprehensive understanding of multithreading with worker threads in Node.js.</p>\n"}
