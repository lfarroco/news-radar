It is a language server for Elixir that just works. With the release of v0.5, Next LS supports various features and is currently supported by popular editors like Emacs, Sublime Text, and more. Although it hasn&#39;t reached feature parity with Elixir LS, it is ready for early adopters who like to stay on the cutting edge. The elixir-tools project, including Credo Language Server, has also seen significant updates and integrations with different editors. Additionally, Tableau, a static site generator for Elixir, has been introduced, providing simplicity and flexibility for developers.
