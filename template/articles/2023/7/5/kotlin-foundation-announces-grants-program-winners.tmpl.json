With a total of 109 applications, the Ecosystem Committee carefully reviewed each project and selected five winners based on their quality, proposals, and alignment with the foundation&#39;s criteria. Each grant recipient will receive $6,000 to further develop and expand their open-source projects. For those who did not receive a grant this time, the foundation encourages them to continue developing their projects and stay updated for future opportunities. Developers can follow the Kotlin Foundation&#39;s website and social media for updates and announcements on subsequent rounds of the grant program.
