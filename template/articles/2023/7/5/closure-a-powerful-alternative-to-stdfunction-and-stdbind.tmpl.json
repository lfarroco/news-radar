Closure is a header-only library that can be easily added to your project by copying the include directory and including &quot;closure/closure.hpp&quot; in your source files.</p>\n<p>Some key features of Closure include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparable to std::function: Closure can store function pointers or any callable object, including pointer to member functions, just like std::function.</li>\n<li>Binding: Closure allows you to fast bind the first n arguments using the constructor or MakeClosure. You can also use placeholders for more complex bindings, with the option to use range placeholders for binding the first n, last n, or middle n arguments.</li>\n<li>Stores non-copyable objects: Unlike std::function, Closure can store non-copyable objects, making it a more versatile choice.</li>\n<li>Auto deduction: MakeClosure in Closure helps you omit the step of writing the complete type of the object you want to construct, making it more convenient to use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compared to std::bind, Closure addresses many of its drawbacks and offers a more robust and efficient solution. While std::bind has been considered deprecated, Closure provides a better alternative for function closure implementation in C++.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Closure and its detailed usage, you can refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/coyorkdow/closure\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n"}
