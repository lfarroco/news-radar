This crate is the recommended way to use regular expressions in Rust, offering worst case linear time searches with respect to the size of the string being searched.</p>\n<p>While releases of the regex crate are not typically announced on their blog, version 1.9 is an exception. With the majority of its internals rewritten, extra scrutiny is encouraged. Any problems or performance regressions can be reported on the issue tracker or discussed on the forum.</p>\n<p>One notable API addition in regex 1.9 is the Captures::extract method, which simplifies the retrieval of capture groups in certain cases. Additionally, users should expect faster search times as a result of the rewrite.</p>\n<p>For more details, developers can refer to the CHANGELOG and a comprehensive blog post on regex crate internals as a library.</p>\n"}
