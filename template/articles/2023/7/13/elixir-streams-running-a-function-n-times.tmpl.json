While developers familiar with Ruby on Rails might be accustomed to the concise N.times { do_something } syntax, Elixir offers a slightly more verbose but powerful solution.</p>\n<p>To run a function repeatedly in Elixir, the author suggests using the Stream.repeatedly function. This function allows developers to create a stream of values that can be consumed by other functions in the Stream module. In this case, the desired function is created using Stream.repeatedly and then executed N times using Enum.take(N).</p>\n<p>This approach showcases the flexibility and composability of Elixir&#39;s functional programming paradigm. By leveraging streams and enumerables, developers can easily manipulate and transform data in a concise and expressive manner.</p>\n<p>For developers interested in keeping up with the latest news and updates on Elixir Streams, the author mentions the option to subscribe to a newsletter that delivers the latest information directly to their inbox.</p>\n<p>Overall, this article provides a useful technique for running a function N times in Elixir using the Stream module. It highlights the unique features and capabilities of Elixir&#39;s functional programming paradigm, making it a valuable language for developers looking to enhance their programming skills.</p>\n"}
