While enums are powerful, they cannot handle generic arguments, which is where sealed classes come in.</p>\n<p>The library works by maintaining a set of classes that have been seen, ensuring that duplicate objects are not created for the same class. If a duplicate object is detected, an exception is thrown.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate the usage of Sealed Enums with generics, the library provides a decent example in the SealedEnumExample class.</p>\n<p>Developers can find the library on GitHub, where they can also contribute to its development. The library is available under the MIT License.</p>\n<p>This library is a valuable tool for developers who want to leverage the benefits of enums while also being able to handle generic arguments. It provides a clean and efficient solution for creating enum-like structures using sealed classes.</p>\n"}
