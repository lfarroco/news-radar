Officially released by JetBrains in 2016, Kotlin has gained popularity among developers due to its concise syntax, null safety, and seamless interoperability with Java.</p>\n<p>Key Features of Kotlin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Concise syntax: Kotlin offers a clean and expressive syntax that reduces boilerplate code and improves readability.</li>\n<li>Null safety: Kotlin&#39;s type system helps developers avoid null pointer exceptions by distinguishing between nullable and non-nullable types.</li>\n<li>Interoperability with Java: Kotlin seamlessly integrates with existing Java code, allowing developers to leverage their Java knowledge and libraries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting Started with Kotlin:\nTo start writing Kotlin code, developers need to have the Kotlin compiler installed on their system. They can download the Kotlin compiler from the official Kotlin website or use Kotlin plugins for popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, or Eclipse.</p>\n<p>Once the compiler or plugin is installed, developers can create Kotlin source files with a .kt extension and start writing Kotlin code. Kotlin code can be compiled and executed just like Java code, as both Kotlin and Java bytecode run on the JVM.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s a simple &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program in Kotlin:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">fun main() {\n    println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Variables and Data Types:\nKotlin provides a rich set of data types, including primitives and reference types. Variables in Kotlin are declared using the <code>val</code> or <code>var</code> keyword, followed by the variable name and an optional type annotation. The <code>val</code> keyword is used for read-only (immutable) variables, while the <code>var</code> keyword is used for mutable variables.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">val message: String = &quot;Hello, Kotlin!&quot;\nvar count: Int = 42\n\ncount = 10\n</code></pre>\n<p>Kotlin supports type inference, so developers can omit the type annotation if the type can be inferred from the initializer expression.</p>\n<p>Kotlin&#39;s data types include Int, Double, String, Boolean, and more. Developers can leverage these data types to store and manipulate different kinds of data in their programs.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Kotlin is a powerful and versatile programming language that offers a modern and concise syntax, null safety, and seamless interoperability with Java. It provides developers with the tools they need to build various types of applications. Whether you&#39;re an Android developer, a server-side developer, or a desktop application developer, Kotlin has something to offer.</p>\n"}
