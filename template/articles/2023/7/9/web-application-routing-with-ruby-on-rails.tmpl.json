In Ruby on Rails, the routing system provides a powerful mechanism that follows RESTful conventions and simplifies URL handling.</p>\n<p>Rails routes are defined using a concise and readable DSL (Domain-Specific Language) in the <code>config/routes.rb</code> file. The routes are defined using the <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>put</code>, <code>patch</code>, <code>delete</code>, or <code>match</code> methods, corresponding to different HTTP verbs. The basic syntax for defining a route is <code>verb &#39;path&#39;, to: &#39;controller#action&#39;</code>, where the verb represents the HTTP method, path denotes the URL pattern, and controller#action specifies the corresponding controller and action to handle the request.</p>\n<p>Rails also provides resourceful routing using the <code>resources</code> method, which generates RESTful routes for a given resource, including CRUD operations.</p>\n<p>Dynamic segments represented as parameters can be included in routes using a colon (:) followed by the parameter name. Rails generates path helpers that make it easier to generate URLs for routes.</p>\n<p>Route constraints allow you to impose conditions on a route, such as accepting specific parameter formats or matching custom logic. Constraints are defined using the <code>constraints</code> option, which takes a block of code.</p>\n<p>Rails also allows for customization of routes through options like custom route constraints, route defaults, and route scoping.</p>\n<p>Engines in Rails are miniature applications that can be mounted within a larger Rails application, bringing additional functionality and components. They allow for packaging and reusing functionality across multiple applications or within a monolithic application.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Ruby on Rails provides a powerful and flexible routing system that follows RESTful conventions, simplifies URL handling, and allows for customization through various options. Engines further enhance the capabilities of Rails by enabling the packaging and reuse of functionality across applications.</p>\n"}
