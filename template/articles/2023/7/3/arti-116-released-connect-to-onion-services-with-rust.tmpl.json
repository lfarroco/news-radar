This release brings client-side onion service support, allowing programs to connect to onion services on the Tor network. However, it&#39;s important to note that this feature is not yet as secure as the equivalent feature in the C tor implementation. The release also introduces key manager functionality, providing a uniform and consistent API and CLI for managing secret keys. Although this functionality is still in a preliminary state with limited usability, developers can experiment with onion service client authorization. For more information on using Arti, refer to the top-level README and the documentation for the arti binary.</p>\n"}
