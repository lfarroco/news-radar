With at least 70 pull requests merged and 43 new contributors, this release is packed with exciting changes.</p>\n<p>One of the major updates in this release is the improved usability of offline mode. Now, each <code>query!()</code> invocation uses a separate file per query, reducing conflicts when merging branches that modify queries. This change aims to streamline collaboration in projects using SQLx.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the SQLite driver has undergone significant revisions to its query analysis, potentially affecting the output of <code>sqlx::query!()</code> and related functions. The removal of the MSSQL driver, which was not at the same maturity level as other drivers, has also been announced. However, plans are in place to introduce a fully featured replacement as a premium offering, along with drivers for other proprietary databases.</p>\n<p>Developers interested in the latest version of SQLx and its features can check out the <a href=\"sqlx/CHANGELOG.md\">CHANGELOG.md</a> file for a comprehensive list of changes. To contribute or inquire about the premium offering, please email <a href=\"mailto:sqlx@launchbadge.com\">sqlx@launchbadge.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates and improvements in the SQLx ecosystem, and make sure to update your projects to leverage the latest enhancements.</p>\n"}
