Jones, discussing the release of Qiq 2.1.0, a template system for PHP. The article highlights a new feature in Qiq, made possible by using PHP tokens during the compiling process. Qiq syntax is similar to PHP, but with added syntax sugar to make it more concise. One issue addressed in the article is the need to use $this-&gt; inside Qiq tags when using a helper under Qiq syntax, but not as the opening keyword. The author explains how this issue was resolved, improving the usability of Qiq. This article is relevant for PHP developers interested in template systems and the latest updates in the PHP ecosystem.</p>\n"}
