Background jobs are an essential part of many applications, allowing time-consuming tasks to be processed asynchronously. However, it can be challenging to provide real-time updates on the progress of these jobs to the user interface.</p>\n<p>The author explains that one approach to solving this problem is by using websockets. Websockets allow for bi-directional communication between the server and the client, enabling real-time updates. The author provides a code snippet showcasing how to implement websockets in a Ruby on Rails application using the ActionCable framework.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the author mentions the importance of handling job failures and provides guidance on how to handle and display error messages to the user.</p>\n<p>Overall, this article serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to enhance their understanding of broadcasting progress from background jobs. By leveraging websockets and following the provided guidance, developers can create more responsive and user-friendly applications.</p>\n"}
