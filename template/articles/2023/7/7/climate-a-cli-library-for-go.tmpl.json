Inspired by python-fire, Climate is built on top of Cobra and comes with &quot;batteries included,&quot; providing features such as help generation, shell completion, and more.</p>\n<p>With Climate, developers can easily autogenerate CLIs from structs and functions, with support for nested subcommands and global/local flags. The library also offers typo suggestions and allows for easy generation of help documentation from godocs.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate the usage of Climate, here&#39;s an example code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">package main\n\nimport (\n    &quot;fmt&quot;\n    &quot;github.com/avamsi/climate&quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    app := climate.NewCliMate()\n    app.Command(&quot;greet&quot;, &quot;Greet someone&quot;, func(c *climate.CliMate) {\n        name := c.String(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, &quot;The name of the person to greet&quot;)\n        c.Action(func() {\n            fmt.Printf(&quot;Hello, %s!\\n&quot;, *name)\n        })\n    })\n\n    app.Run()\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Climate provides a seamless experience for developers looking to create CLIs in Go. It simplifies the process and offers a range of features that make CLI development more efficient and enjoyable. With its intuitive interface and extensive documentation, Climate is a valuable tool for developers looking to keep up with the latest trends in the industry.</p>\n"}
