Throughout the workshop, you will gain practical experience in setting up a Rust project with Actix-Web, implementing CRUD operations for movies, establishing database connectivity with PostgreSQL using SQLx, designing a responsive front-end with Dioxus, and deploying the application using Shuttle.</p>\n<p>This workshop assumes that you have a basic understanding of Rust and its syntax. If you need a refresher, please refer to the Prerequisites section of the workshop guide.</p>\n<p>By the end of the workshop, you will have built a functional movie collection manager application and gained insights into building full stack applications with Rust. The workshop duration is approximately 4.5 hours.</p>\n<p>Repository Structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>backend</code>: Contains the Rust project with Actix-Web for the API and SQLx for database connectivity.</li>\n<li><code>frontend</code>: Contains the Dioxus files for the responsive front-end design.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop guide: [link]</li>\n<li>Repository: [link]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the workshop and find it valuable for your journey in building full stack applications with Rust, Actix, SQLx, Dioxus, and Shuttle. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask during the workshop. Happy coding!</p>\n"}
