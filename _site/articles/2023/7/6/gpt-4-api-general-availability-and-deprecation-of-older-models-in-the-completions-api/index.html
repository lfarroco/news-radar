			<div class="disclaimer"> This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability">here</a>. </div>
			<p>The GPT-4 API is now generally available for all paying API customers. This highly capable model has been eagerly awaited by millions of developers since its introduction in March. With the GPT-4 API, developers can create innovative products that leverage the power of this advanced language model.</p>
<p>In addition to the GPT-4 API, OpenAI has also made the GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALLÂ·E, and Whisper APIs generally available. These models have been deemed stable and ready for production-scale use. OpenAI is also working on enabling fine-tuning for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, with plans to release this feature later in the year.</p>
<p>OpenAI is shifting its focus from text completions to chat completions. The Chat Completions API, introduced in March, has quickly become the preferred choice for developers, accounting for 97% of API GPT usage. This chat-based paradigm offers a more structured prompt interface, providing better results and greater flexibility. The API&#39;s multi-turn conversation capabilities and structured interface enable developers to build conversational experiences and a wide range of completion tasks.</p>
<p>To encourage developers to transition to the Chat Completions API, OpenAI has announced a deprecation plan for older models in the Completions API. These older models will be retired at the beginning of 2024. OpenAI recommends that users adopt the Chat Completions API, as it offers enhanced capabilities and reduces the risk of prompt injection attacks.</p>
<p>OpenAI is committed to investing in the development of the Chat Completions API, as they believe it offers a more capable and user-friendly experience for developers. They are actively working on improving the API by adding features such as log probabilities for completion tokens and increased steerability to reduce excessive &quot;chattiness&quot; in responses.</p>
<p>Developers can now take advantage of the GPT-4 API and explore the possibilities it offers. With the availability of the GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALLÂ·E, and Whisper APIs, developers have a range of powerful language models at their disposal. By transitioning to the Chat Completions API, developers can harness the benefits of a more structured and conversational approach to building applications. OpenAI&#39;s deprecation plan for older models in the Completions API ensures that developers stay up to date with the latest advancements in language models and can make the most of the cutting-edge technologies available.</p>
