	<h1>Unidirectional flow in Swift</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Swift, a language known for its type-safe code and powerful language features, also offers a robust state management approach. In this article, the author explores the concept of unidirectional flow in Swift and demonstrates how to build a predictable, testable, debuggable, and modular state management system.</p>
<p>To achieve type-safe state management, Swift leverages value types, enums, optionals, protocols, generics, and phantom types. By using these language features, developers can encode the correct behavior into the type system, catching logical mistakes at compile-time rather than runtime.</p>
<p>The article provides a basic example of a state management system built in Swift. The central component is the Store type, which holds the current state and provides a send function to mutate the state by accepting a generic action. The Observable macro ensures that any changes to the state are notified.</p>
<p>One of the key goals of this state management system is predictability. The only way to mutate the state is by sending a predefined action. Views and view controllers can only read the state, ensuring that changes to the state are controlled and predictable. The reduce function, responsible for state updates, contains the state update logic and can be composed of multiple reduce functions for different feature modules.</p>
<p>This approach, known as unidirectional flow, ensures that there is only one direction for state changes. Views send actions, the store updates the state, and the updated state is reflected in the view. By adopting this approach, developers can easily understand and manage their app's state.</p>
<p>In addition to predictability, this state management system is also highly testable. The reduce function, being a pure function, takes the current state and action as parameters and returns a new state. Since both state and action are value types, developers can write unit tests to verify the correctness of the state transitions.</p>
<p>Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of unidirectional flow in Swift and demonstrates how to build a functional and safe state management system. By leveraging Swift's language features, developers can ensure type-safe code and achieve predictable, testable, and modular state management.</p>
