			<p>Microsoft has recently released a new course called &quot;AI for Beginners&quot; aimed at teaching the basics of Artificial Intelligence to everyone. The course is designed to be accessible to anyone, regardless of their technical background. It consists of 24 lessons spread over 12 weeks, covering topics such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and ethics in AI.</p>
<p>The course is available for free on Microsoft&#39;s website and is licensed under the MIT license. It has already gained a lot of popularity, with over 13k stars and 2.2k forks on GitHub. The course is also available in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic.</p>
<p>The course is designed to be hands-on, with each lesson including practical exercises and code snippets. The course uses Python as its primary programming language, and the code snippets are provided in Jupyter notebooks. The course also uses various tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.</p>
<p>One of the unique aspects of this course is its focus on ethics in AI. The course covers topics such as bias in AI, privacy concerns, and the ethical implications of AI. This is an essential aspect of AI that is often overlooked, and it&#39;s great to see Microsoft taking the initiative to educate people on this topic.</p>
<p>Overall, &quot;AI for Beginners&quot; is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning the basics of AI. It&#39;s accessible, hands-on, and covers a broad range of topics. It&#39;s also great to see Microsoft taking the initiative to educate people on the ethical implications of AI.</p>
