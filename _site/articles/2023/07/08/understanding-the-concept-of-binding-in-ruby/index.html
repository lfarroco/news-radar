		<p>Binding is an elegant way to access the current scope (variables, methods, and self) in Ruby. It is commonly used for building view templates and executing strings of Ruby code. In this article, we will explore what binding is and how it works.</p>
<p>A Ruby binding is an instance of the Binding class. It encapsulates the current scope, allowing you to pass it around in your code. The Kernel#binding method returns the current binding object. Think of this binding object as a wrapper that encapsulates the current programming environment, including variables, methods, and the self object.</p>
<p>One common use case for a binding object is to fill pre-defined slots in a template, such as ERB views. By saving the current context including variables in a binding, you can use it later to generate the final views.</p>
<p>You can evaluate Ruby code in different contexts using the Kernel#eval method. By passing a binding object as the second argument, you establish the environment for the evaluation. This allows you to execute code in the context of that binding.</p>
<p>Ruby provides a constant called TOPLEVEL_BINDING that returns the binding of the top-level scope. This can be useful for accessing the top-level scope from anywhere in the program.</p>
<p>ERB, a popular templating engine in Ruby, uses the Kernel#binding method to substitute variables into a template string. This allows you to dynamically generate content based on the current context.</p>
<p>Understanding the concept of binding in Ruby is essential for developers working with view templates and executing dynamic code. It provides a powerful tool for manipulating and accessing the current scope. By using binding objects, you can create flexible and reusable code that adapts to different contexts.</p>
<p>To learn more about binding and its practical applications, be sure to check out the source code of the IRB gem, which makes abundant use of bindings. Additionally, you can refer to the previous post on rendering dynamic views for a deeper understanding of how binding is used in practice.</p>
