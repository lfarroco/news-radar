		<p>JetBrains, the company behind the popular IntelliJ IDEA IDE, has announced the addition of a new AI Assistant feature to their suite of development tools. This major update brings generative AI and large language models to the fingertips of developers, revolutionizing the way they write code and generate documentation.</p>
<p>The AI Assistant is powered by the JetBrains AI service, which connects users to various large language models, including OpenAI. This integration allows developers to have conversations with the AI Assistant, ask questions, and iterate on tasks. The IDE provides project-specific context, such as the languages and technologies used, to enhance the AI-generated code. Developers can easily insert the AI-generated code into their editor or copy it over.</p>
<p>In addition to code generation, the AI Assistant also supports documentation generation for Java, Kotlin, and Python. By using the AI Actions menu, developers can generate documentation for a declaration using the language models. This feature is particularly useful when generating doc comment stubs, as the AI Assistant can generate the dynamic part of the comment based on the statically known information.</p>
<p>The AI Assistant is currently available in pre-release versions of JetBrains IDEs, with a separate plugin for stable releases. However, access to the AI Assistant may be limited by a waitlist. JetBrains plans to expand the AI service to include more providers and support local and on-premises models in the future.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the AI Assistant, JetBrains is at the forefront of leveraging AI technology in the development process. This exciting addition empowers developers to write code more efficiently and generate accurate documentation with ease. Stay tuned for more updates on this groundbreaking feature from JetBrains.</p>
