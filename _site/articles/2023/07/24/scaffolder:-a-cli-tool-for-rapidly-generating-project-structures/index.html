		<p>Scaffolder is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Golang that aims to automate the tedious task of creating project skeletons with boilerplate code. It allows developers to quickly kick-start their projects by generating a skeleton project structure based on a configurable YAML file.</p>
<p>The tool takes advantage of a reusable config YAML file, which defines the necessary directory structure for the project. This YAML file is both human-friendly and easily parseable, making it convenient for developers to work with.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how Scaffolder works, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have a project called &quot;hello1&quot; that requires a folder named &quot;hello.txt&quot; and three files inside it. With Scaffolder, creating this structure is straightforward and effortless.</p>
<p>In addition to its simplicity, Scaffolder offers several useful features. For instance, it can automatically initialize a Git repository within the generated project by setting the &quot;git&quot; parameter to true in the YAML file.</p>
<p>To install Scaffolder, you can choose between downloading the pre-built executable for your operating system or building it from source if you prefer. The tool supports Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.</p>
<p>Scaffolder has gained popularity among developers for its efficiency and flexibility. It saves valuable time by eliminating the need to manually create project structures and write repetitive boilerplate code. With Scaffolder, developers can focus on the core aspects of their projects, increasing productivity and accelerating development.</p>
<p>If you want to explore more examples and learn about advanced usage scenarios, the project's documentation provides detailed instructions and pseudocode snippets. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a beginner, Scaffolder is a valuable tool that can streamline your project setup process and enhance your overall development experience.</p>
