		<p>The sbt project has announced the release of sbt 1.9.3, a patch release that brings several improvements and bug fixes to the popular build tool for Scala projects. This release is part of the ongoing efforts to enhance the Scala tooling ecosystem and provide developers with a more efficient and reliable development experience.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of sbt 1.9.3 is the introduction of actionable diagnostics, also known as quickfix. This feature allows developers to receive code actions directly from the compiler, making it easier to identify and fix issues in their code. With the new AnalysisCallback2 interface, code actions can now be relayed from the compiler to Zinc's Analysis file, providing a seamless integration between the two tools. This feature is currently available for Scala 2.13.x and Scala 3, with future releases expected to include proper code actions.</p>
<p>To upgrade to sbt 1.9.3, developers can download the official sbt runner from SDKMAN or directly from the sbt GitHub repository. Additionally, the sbt version used for a specific build can be upgraded by adding the appropriate configuration to the project/build.properties file.</p>
<p>The sbt project would like to express their gratitude to the community for their contributions and support. They encourage developers to get involved and help improve sbt and Zinc by reporting bugs, contributing code, and participating in discussions. The project also highlights the importance of supporting organizations that provide assistance to LGBTIQ+ refugees, such as the fundraising campaign by Forbidden Colours.</p>
<p>For more information about sbt 1.9.3 and its features, developers can refer to the official release notes available on the sbt GitHub repository.</p>
