		<p>Elixir, a dynamic and functional programming language built on the Erlang virtual machine, continues to be a safe choice for developers. In a recent article titled &quot;Elixir is Safe,&quot; Nathan Long highlighted the security benefits of using Elixir, particularly in terms of memory and thread safety. This article resonated with programmers and executives alike, emphasizing the importance of security in software development.</p>
<p>However, a recent publication titled &quot;Vision for a Secure Elixir Ecosystem: An Empirical Study of Vulnerabilities in Elixir Programs&quot; has sparked a discussion. This paper, published by the ACM in April 2022, challenges the claims made in Nathan's article. It argues that practitioner perceptions of Elixir's safety and security are subjective and should be validated through empirical investigation.</p>
<p>While the paper's intention is commendable, it overlooks crucial aspects mentioned in Nathan's article. Elixir's memory safety and thread safety features significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities, such as data races, which can have severe consequences in sensitive domains like banking and healthcare.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the empirical study mentioned in the paper does not come as a surprise, as vulnerabilities exist in software written in any language. Comparing Elixir to a type of asphalt that reduces potholes, the paper focuses solely on the presence of vulnerabilities without acknowledging the significant reduction in their occurrence.</p>
<p>Developers should consider both articles to gain a comprehensive understanding of Elixir's security benefits. While the empirical study sheds light on vulnerabilities in Elixir programs, it is equally important to recognize the language's memory and thread safety advantages. By combining empirical evidence with the insights provided by Nathan's article, developers can make informed decisions when developing secure software using Elixir.</p>
