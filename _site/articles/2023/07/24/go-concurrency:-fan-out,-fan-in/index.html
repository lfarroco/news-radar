		<p>Go Concurrency: Fan-out, Fan-in is an article that explores the concept of fan-out, fan-in in Go programming language. The author starts by introducing a mosaic generator program that utilizes concurrent processing to handle a large number of tiles made from source images. The program consists of two phases: indexing and swapping, both of which can proceed concurrently.</p>
<p>The article highlights the building blocks of concurrent Go code, which are functions that emit a stream of values to a channel. These functions, referred to as generators, follow the rule of having only one writer and closing the channel. The author emphasizes the ease of concurrency in Go when following these rules.</p>
<p>The article also introduces the concept of fan-out, where multiple copies of a generator function can be run concurrently, each receiving the same input channel. This allows for parallel processing and analysis of images. The author suggests experimenting with the number of workers to find an optimal value.</p>
<p>For developers interested in Go concurrency, understanding fan-out, fan-in is crucial. It provides a versatile pattern that can be applied to various concurrent processing tasks. The article serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to keep up with the latest Go programming techniques and patterns.</p>
<p>Overall, Go Concurrency: Fan-out, Fan-in offers insights into the power and flexibility of Go's concurrency features, making it a must-read for developers seeking to enhance their Go programming skills.</p>
