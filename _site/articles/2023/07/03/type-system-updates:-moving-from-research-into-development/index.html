		<p>In a recent announcement at ElixirConf EU 2022, the Elixir community shared their progress on developing a type system for the language. Led by Giuseppe Castagna and supported by Guillaume Duboc as part of his PhD studies, the team aims to create a type system that can effectively model Elixir's functional semantics while also introducing new theories to address any incompatibilities or limitations.</p>
<p>After months of research, the team has successfully developed a gradual set-theoretic type system that aligns with their goals. They are now ready to transition into the development phase. During this time, the team has focused on refining the semantics of the type system and exploring a new syntax to express it. Although the syntax is not yet finalized, the community can expect user-facing changes to the language in the future.</p>
<p>To facilitate further discussions and gather feedback from the community, the team plans to engage in conversations about the type system interface and its syntax once they are confident in the proposed changes. This collaborative effort has been made possible through a partnership between the CNRS and Remote, with sponsorship from various organizations.</p>
<p>Developers interested in keeping up with the latest news on Elixir's type system can find more information and resources on the progress made by the team over the past two months. This exciting development opens up new possibilities for Elixir developers, providing them with a more robust and expressive programming experience.</p>
