		<p>The sbt project has announced the release of sbt 1.9.2, a patch release that brings several improvements and bug fixes. This version fixes cross-building support for mixed Scala patch versions, specifically addressing the issues with the <code>+</code> and <code>++</code> commands.</p>
<p>sbt's stateful cross-building feature has undergone several iterations, and this fix was contributed by @eed3si9n in issue #7328. The full release notes can be found on the project's GitHub page at <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.2">https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.2</a>.</p>
<p>The sbt project would like to express their gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the improvement of sbt and Zinc by using them, reporting bugs, improving documentation, porting builds and plugins, and submitting and reviewing pull requests. If you're interested in contributing to sbt, there are various avenues for you to get involved, including contributing code, participating in discussions, and tackling &quot;help wanted&quot; and &quot;good first issue&quot; tasks.</p>
