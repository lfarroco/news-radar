		<p>Lemmy, the open-source federated alternative to Reddit, is getting a brand new frontend called lemmy-ui-leptos. Developed using Leptos, a Rust UI framework with isomorphic support, this new frontend aims to replace the existing lemmy-ui. The project also utilizes Tailwind and DaisyUI for component styling.</p>
<p>The new frontend is being designed by a team of skilled UI developers, while the author focuses on the backend structure, authentication, services, and parameters. One of the advantages of contributing to this project is that you don't necessarily need to learn Rust, as the component structure is similar to JSX.</p>
<p>Currently, only the home page and post pages are functional, but they are ready to be styled. The project welcomes contributions from the developer community, and instructions for running it can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.</p>
<p>But what's the point of using DaisyUI and Tailwind together? Tailwind allows for faster styling with atomic classes directly in HTML, eliminating the need for custom CSS. DaisyUI, on the other hand, introduces semantic class names that combine various low-level Tailwind classes. This simplifies the styling process and ensures consistency among developers.</p>
<p>Concerns have been raised about the performance of Tailwind due to its large utility CSS file. However, Tailwind compilers only include the classes that are actually used, resulting in a smaller file size compared to other frameworks.</p>
<p>While some may argue that building static pages with native web technologies would yield a faster site, the decision to use frameworks like Leptos and Tailwind is driven by the desire for a consistent and efficient development process. Additionally, Rust's adoption as an alternative to JavaScript offers the potential for improved performance and reliability.</p>
<p>Overall, the development of the new Lemmy frontend showcases the growing interest in Rust as a language for building user interfaces. With its isomorphic support and integration with popular frameworks like Tailwind and DaisyUI, Lemmy is poised to offer a more polished and user-friendly experience for its community.</p>
