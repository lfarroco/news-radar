		<p>The latest release of Fyrox Game Engine, version 0.31, brings several exciting improvements and features for game developers. Fyrox is a modern game engine written in Rust, designed to help developers create 2D and 3D games with ease using its native editor. Similar to Godot, Fyrox offers a powerful yet lightweight alternative for game development.</p>
<p>One of the major highlights of this release is the significant improvements made to the editor. Developers can now enjoy custom plugins, allowing them to extend the functionality of the editor according to their specific needs. These plugins can range from simple tools to complex functionalities, saving developers valuable time by eliminating tedious tasks. Additionally, the editor now supports opening multiple scenes simultaneously, making it easier to work with prefabs and switch between different scenes.</p>
<p>The ability to focus the editor's camera on an object has also been introduced in this release. By double-clicking on an object in the World Viewer or using the [F] hotkey, developers can quickly locate and focus on a selected object, particularly useful when dealing with complex scenes containing numerous objects.</p>
<p>Another notable improvement is the ability to save and load the layout of editor panels. This feature enhances usability by allowing developers to customize their workspace according to their preferences. For instance, if working with the animation editor, developers can now undock and hide it by default, saving time by not having to manually open and dock it every time the editor is restarted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, opening scenes has become more convenient with additional options. Instead of navigating through the File menu, developers can now simply right-click on a scene in the asset browser and select &quot;Open.&quot; This streamlines the workflow and eliminates the need for unnecessary steps.</p>
<p>Fyrox Game Engine 0.31 is a testament to the continuous improvements and enhancements being made in the Rust game development ecosystem. With its user-friendly editor, customizable plugins, and efficient features, Fyrox offers a promising platform for developers to create engaging games.</p>
