		<p>Molecule, a Compose-based library for managing application state, has reached a major milestone with the release of version 1.0. This stable release brings exciting new features that enhance the development experience for Compose UI apps.</p>
<p>One of the key features introduced in Molecule 1.0 is the ability to separate state-producing composables from UI-rendering composables. This separation allows for increased reusability and simplifies testing. Developers can now easily use the CounterText() composable with @Preview and Paparazzi snapshot testing, while the state-producing counter() composable becomes more powerful when used alongside Molecule's features.</p>
<p>Migrating a large, View-based Android app to Compose UI can be a time-consuming process. However, with Molecule, developers can migrate the state logic to Compose early on and expose it to Views as a StateFlow. This approach enables developers to reuse existing logic written in libraries like RxJava during the UI rewrite, saving time and effort.</p>
<p>Molecule also offers the ability to separate the clock from the UI framework. In scenarios where it doesn't make sense to recompose the counter() composable at the rate of the UI framework, Molecule's &quot;immediate&quot; recomposition mode triggers whenever there are new changes to produce. This allows for more control and flexibility in managing state.</p>
<p>Additionally, Molecule's multiplatform support opens up new possibilities for developers. It runs on every Kotlin multiplatform target supported by the JetBrains Compose runtime, including platforms like iOS targeting SwiftUI or the web targeting the DOM. This means that developers can now run their counter() composable on various platforms, expanding the reach and versatility of their projects.</p>
<p>Whether you're building a 100% Compose UI Android app or a Kotlin multiplatform project with multiple targets, Molecule is a powerful tool that simplifies state management using Compose. With its stable 1.0 release, developers can confidently leverage Molecule to enhance their Compose development workflow.</p>
<p>This article is part of Cash App's Summer of Kotlin Multiplatform series, which aims to explore the capabilities and benefits of Kotlin's multiplatform capabilities in modern app development.</p>
