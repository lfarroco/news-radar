		<p>Metals, a language server for Scala, has reached a significant milestone with the release of version 1.0.0. This highly anticipated release is the result of extensive collaboration between the community and the core Metals team. With this update, Metals now offers support for most of the important Language Server Protocol (LSP) features and more, making it comparable to many popular IDEs.</p>
<p>While version 1.0.0 marks a significant achievement, it does not mean that Metals development will come to a halt. On the contrary, the team is committed to continuously improving Metals and adding new features to enhance the productivity and stability of the Scala development environment. In fact, they have already introduced reporting improvements to help identify and address any issues that users may encounter.</p>
<p>One notable enhancement in this release is the addition of multi-root projects support. Previously, Metals could only be used in workspaces with a single root. However, with the latest update, Metals now works seamlessly across all folders in a workspace, including those added later. This improvement ensures a consistent experience for developers working with multi-root projects.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy addition is the hover support in Java files. Thanks to the contribution from VankaTaganai, Scala developers can now hover over names in Java files to gain more information about them. While this feature does not provide the full functionality of a Java language server, it offers basic functionality that proves invaluable when working with Java source code.</p>
<p>Metals is compatible with popular code editors such as VS Code, Vim, Emacs, and Sublime Text. Developed by the Scala Center and VirtusLab, with contributions from Lunatech and the community, Metals aims to provide Scala developers with a powerful and efficient development environment.</p>
<p>To learn more about Metals and give it a try, visit the official website at <a href="https://scalameta.org/metals/">https://scalameta.org/metals/</a>. With its continuous improvement and commitment to excellence, Metals is poised to become the go-to tool for Scala developers seeking a productive and stable development environment.</p>
