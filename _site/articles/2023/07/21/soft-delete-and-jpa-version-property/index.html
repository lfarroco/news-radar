		<p>In this article, the author explores the implementation of a soft delete mechanism in JPA entities that feature a version property. The article begins by highlighting the benefits of using a tool called Hypersistence Optimizer, which can automatically detect JPA and Hibernate performance issues. The tool is compatible with popular frameworks such as Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Jakarta EE, Java EE, Quarkus, and Play Framework.</p>
<p>The author then delves into the concept of soft delete and explains how it can be implemented in JPA entities. By utilizing a version property for optimistic locking, developers can easily incorporate a soft delete strategy. The article provides a domain model example, showcasing the implementation of soft delete in entities such as Post, PostDetails, PostComment, and Tag.</p>
<p>To enable soft delete in Hibernate, the author demonstrates how to configure the framework to execute an UPDATE statement that sets the deleted column to true when a relevant entity is marked for deletion. This approach ensures that the entity remains in the database but is logically considered deleted.</p>
<p>For developers seeking to optimize their production systems and avoid performance issues, this article offers valuable insights into implementing a soft delete mechanism using JPA and Hibernate. By leveraging a version property and following the provided guidelines, developers can effectively manage their data while maintaining data integrity and performance.</p>
<p>Overall, this article serves as a useful resource for developers looking to stay up-to-date with the latest techniques and best practices in the industry, specifically in relation to soft delete and JPA version property.</p>
