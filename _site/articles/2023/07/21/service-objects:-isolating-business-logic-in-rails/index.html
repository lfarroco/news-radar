		<p>In the world of Ruby on Rails development, the question of where and how to implement business logic has long been a topic of debate. From fat controllers to concerns, developers have tried various approaches to keep their codebase clean and maintainable. One approach that has gained popularity in recent years is the use of service objects.</p>
<p>Service objects, also known as service classes or interactors, provide a way to encapsulate and isolate business logic from the rest of the application. They act as a layer between the controller and the model, handling complex operations and making the code more modular and testable.</p>
<p>At SportsKey, a company that specializes in web development, they have been using service objects to great effect. According to Thilo Rusche, a developer at SportsKey, service objects have helped them improve their codebase and make it easier to understand the capabilities of each class.</p>
<p>Unlike other solutions that rely on external gems or frameworks, the beauty of service objects lies in their simplicity. By rolling your own service objects, you have full control over the implementation and can avoid adding unnecessary complexity to your codebase.</p>
<p>So how do you structure and use service objects in Rails? The article provides a typical example of how a service object can be called in a controller action. It follows a simple convention of parsing and validating input, delegating processing to the service object, and outputting the result.</p>
<p>While service objects may not be a silver bullet for all your coding problems, they offer a clean and straightforward way to handle business logic in Rails applications. By adopting this approach, developers can keep their codebase organized, maintainable, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about service objects and how they can benefit your Rails projects, &quot;Sustainable Web Development with Ruby on Rails&quot; by David Bryan Copeland is a recommended read. It provides an in-depth guide to real-world Rails development and covers various best practices, including the use of service objects.</p>
<p>So why not give service objects a try? They might just be the missing piece in your Rails development puzzle.</p>
