		<p>Event-driven systems have become increasingly popular in the world of software development. However, like any other architectural approach, they come with their own set of challenges and potential pitfalls. In this article, we will explore some of the hidden dangers that developers should be aware of when designing event-driven systems, as well as provide best practices for mitigating these risks.</p>
<p>One of the main trade-offs of adopting an event-driven system is the additional latency it introduces. Messages must traverse multiple hops within the system before they are fully processed, which can result in increased response times. While this latency can be outweighed by the benefits of resiliency and architectural simplicity, it is important to monitor and address any unexpected increases in latency. Lag spikes can significantly impact the user experience and may be caused by factors such as resource constraints or inefficient database queries. Developers need to quickly identify the root cause of these spikes and devise plans to reduce them.</p>
<p>To effectively deal with lag, developers should follow two main steps: identification and planning. The identification stage involves pinpointing the bottlenecks and understanding why they occur. This requires comprehensive monitoring and logging tools that provide insights into the system's performance. Once the issues have been identified, developers can devise plans to remedy them, whether it be through optimizing code, allocating additional resources, or revisiting the system's architecture.</p>
<p>Keeping up with the latest news and best practices in event-driven systems is crucial for developers who want to build robust and efficient applications. By understanding the potential dangers and implementing proactive measures, developers can ensure the success of their event-driven projects.</p>
