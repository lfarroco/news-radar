			This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://shafik.github.io/c++/2023/07/09/lets-enumerate-ub-part-1.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.

		<p>In this article, the author discusses the concept of undefined behavior (UB) in the C++ programming language. The author mentions that they have been working on a project to enumerate the various forms of UB and explore their consequences. They plan to cover each UB in the order they appear in the C++ standard.</p>
<p>The article highlights the difference between undefined behavior and ill-formed no diagnostic required (IFNDR). While undefined behavior refers to runtime properties of a program, IFNDR is a static property that makes a program ill-formed but does not require the compiler to diagnose it.</p>
<p>The author specifically focuses on the lexer section of the C++ standard, which contains two cases of undefined behavior. However, they mention that these cases are expected to be removed in C++26. They provide an example of a line splice that results in a universal-character-name, which is currently considered undefined behavior but may be supported as well-formed in the future.</p>
<p>The article concludes by mentioning that the next undefined behavior in the lexer section is related to unterminated single or double quotes. The author suggests referring to the C++ standard for more details on this topic.</p>
<p>Developers interested in keeping up with the latest news and updates in the C++ programming language will find this article helpful in understanding and identifying undefined behavior in their code.</p>
