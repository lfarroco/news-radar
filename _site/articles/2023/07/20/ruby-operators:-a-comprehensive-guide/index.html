		<p>Ruby is known for its extensive set of operators, each with its own meaning and context. In this article, we will explore the various types of operators in Ruby and their functionalities.</p>
<p>The first category of operators we encounter are the call operators. These operators are used to call methods and specify the manner in which the method should be called. They include the call name operators, which are the names of methods on objects. These operators can be used as unary or binary expressions, or in their call form.</p>
<p>Moving on, we have the unary call name operators, which represent arithmetic operations. These operators have fast paths in Ruby implementations when the receiver is a numeric type. Additionally, there are bitwise call name operators, comparison call name operators, and miscellaneous call name operators.</p>
<p>Next, we delve into the assignment operators. These operators involve reading a value, performing an operation on it, and assigning it back to the receiver. It's important to note that the target of the expression can greatly impact the semantics of the operator. The target can be any variable type or method call, with the method name automatically changed by appending an '='.</p>
<p>Similar to the arithmetic call name operators, we have arithmetic assignment operators. These operators perform arithmetic operations and assign the result back to the receiver. Additionally, there are bitwise assignment operators and miscellaneous assignment operators.</p>
<p>The control-flow operators come next, including keywords that function similarly to infix operators. These operators are used for conditional expressions, truthiness checks, and pattern matching.</p>
<p>Lastly, we encounter the range operators, which can be used to create ranges, both inclusive and exclusive. They can also be used to create flip-flops under specific conditions.</p>
<p>By understanding these operators, developers can leverage the full power of Ruby and write more expressive and concise code. Stay tuned to Dev Radar for more updates on Ruby and other programming languages.</p>
