		<p>Overarch is a tool that provides architecture descriptions as data based on the C4 model, offering multiple use cases for this data. It supports diagram generation with PlantUML, allowing developers to create expressive and reusable models of their software architecture.</p>
<p>The value of using Overarch lies in its ability to visualize an architecture on different levels of detail with various types of diagrams. However, the existing tools for diagram generation often fall short in terms of generality. Descriptions written in PlantUML files are limited to rendering them as text files, lacking the ability to compose and manipulate the data.</p>
<p>Overarch addresses these limitations by separating the model data from information about its representations. This allows developers to compose models with different views and even integrate them with other models. By doing so, the model can be used in various ways, such as generating documentation, code, or infrastructure.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of Overarch is its use of a text file format (EDN or JSON) for the model data. This makes it easy to edit the model using text editors and collaborate with the entire team. Additionally, the text file format enables version control, ensuring that the model remains consistent and accessible throughout the development process.</p>
<p>With Overarch, developers have a powerful tool at their disposal for creating and managing software architecture descriptions. Its ability to generate diagrams and support for composable models make it an invaluable asset for developers looking to keep up with the latest trends in architectural design.</p>
