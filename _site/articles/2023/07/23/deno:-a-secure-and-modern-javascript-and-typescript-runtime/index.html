		<p>Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, created by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js. It aims to address some of the limitations and security concerns of Node.js while providing a modern and developer-friendly environment.</p>
<p>One of the notable features of Deno is its built-in support for TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript. This allows developers to write code in TypeScript and have it seamlessly run in Deno without the need for additional configuration or transpilation steps. This is particularly beneficial for teams that prefer the type safety and tooling that TypeScript provides.</p>
<p>In addition to TypeScript support, Deno also introduces a new set of APIs for performing common tasks such as file system access, network requests, and process management. These APIs are designed to be more secure and intuitive compared to their counterparts in Node.js.</p>
<p>Deno also places a strong emphasis on security. By default, Deno runs in a sandboxed environment and only has access to the necessary permissions explicitly granted by the user. This helps prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive resources on the user's machine.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy feature of Deno is its support for full duplex streaming. This allows developers to create bidirectional communication channels between the server and the client, enabling real-time data transfer and interaction.</p>
<p>With its focus on security, modern features, and developer experience, Deno is gaining traction among developers who are looking for an alternative to Node.js. Its active community and regular updates make it an exciting technology to keep an eye on for developers who want to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the industry.</p>
<p>So, if you're a developer looking for a secure and modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, Deno might just be the tool you've been waiting for.</p>
