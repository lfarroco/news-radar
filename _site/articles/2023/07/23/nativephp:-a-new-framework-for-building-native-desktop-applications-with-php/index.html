		<p>NativePHP is a revolutionary framework that allows PHP developers to quickly build rich, cross-platform desktop applications using familiar tools and technologies. With NativePHP, developers can leverage their existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to create powerful native apps.</p>
<p>Unlike other frameworks, NativePHP is not opinionated about how you build your app. Whether you prefer Laravel, React, Vue, Livewire, Inertia, or even plain HTML and CSS, NativePHP supports them all. This flexibility empowers developers to choose the UI toolset that makes them and their team most productive.</p>
<p>NativePHP is not a custom fork of PHP. It is built on the solid foundation of the PHP language that developers know and love. This means that developers can take advantage of the vast PHP ecosystem and libraries while building their native apps.</p>
<p>The framework comes with a range of useful features out of the box, including effortless installation, routing, database integration, and more. The comprehensive documentation provides detailed guidance on how to make the most of these features.</p>
<p>With NativePHP, the possibilities are endless. Developers can build anything they can imagine, from menubar apps to launcher apps and even quirky apps like a screen recorder that adds cowboy hats to smiley-face emojis.</p>
<p>To get started with NativePHP, developers can visit the official documentation, which covers everything from installation to advanced usage. The framework is open source and available on GitHub, allowing developers to contribute and shape its future.</p>
<p>NativePHP is a testament to the hard work of its creators, Marcel Pociot and Simon Hamp. Their dedication and the support of the open-source community have made this innovative framework a reality.</p>
<p>Join the NativePHP revolution and unleash your creativity in building native desktop applications with PHP.</p>
