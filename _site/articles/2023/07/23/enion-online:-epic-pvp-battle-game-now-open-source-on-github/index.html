		<p>Enion Online, an immersive Epic PvP Battle game between Orcs and Humans, has recently been made open source on GitHub. This exciting game is written using Clojure and ClojureScript, two powerful programming languages known for their simplicity and conciseness. The game also utilizes the PlayCanvas game engine, which provides stunning 3D graphics and a seamless multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>By making Enion Online open source, the developers have invited the programming community to contribute to the game's development and improvement. This means that developers can now explore the game's source code, suggest enhancements, and even create their own modifications. It's a great opportunity for developers to learn from a real-world game project and collaborate with others in the community.</p>
<p>To get started with Enion Online, developers need to install the necessary prerequisites and set up the game client and backend. The repository on GitHub provides detailed instructions on how to do this. Once set up, developers can access the game client in their browser and start playing or making modifications.</p>
<p>This open source release of Enion Online is a significant development for the Clojure and ClojureScript communities. It showcases the versatility and potential of these languages in creating complex and engaging games. Developers interested in game development or looking to contribute to an open source project should definitely check out Enion Online on GitHub. It's an exciting opportunity to be a part of the game's evolution and learn from experienced developers in the field.</p>
