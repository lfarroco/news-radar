		<p>Membrane is a versatile UI library that provides developers with all the necessary tools to build a user interface. Whether you're targeting desktop, web, or mobile platforms, Membrane has got you covered. What sets Membrane apart is its flexibility and compatibility with various UI frameworks. Developers can mix and match different implementations or use their favorite UI framework alongside Membrane.</p>
<p>Unlike other UI toolkits that are based on object-oriented models, Membrane takes advantage of the functional features found in libraries targeting the browser, such as React, Reagent, Re-frame, and Fulcro. Views in Membrane are treated as values, and components and event handlers are pure functions. This functional approach allows for more maintainable and scalable code.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Membrane is its support for multiple platforms. It can run on various platforms, including desktop, web, and experimental platforms. Additionally, Membrane offers experimental UI framework integrations, giving developers the freedom to choose the framework that best suits their needs.</p>
<p>To get started with Membrane, developers can refer to the comprehensive documentation organized by topic. The documentation covers everything from basic usage to advanced topics like distributing desktop apps and targeting WebGL. Membrane also provides examples and tutorials to help developers understand and implement the library effectively.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or want to connect with the Membrane community, you can join the Clojurians Slack channel in #membrane or discuss on Twitter. Membrane is an exciting addition to the UI development landscape, offering developers a simple yet powerful library to create user interfaces that run anywhere.</p>
