		<p>Elixir, a functional programming language, has been gaining popularity among developers, especially those coming from a Ruby background. Created by JosÃ© Valim, a prominent Ruby developer, Elixir offers a syntax that may resemble Ruby at first glance, but the two languages differ significantly in their underlying designs.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial differences between Elixir and Ruby is that Elixir is not object-oriented. Unlike Ruby, Elixir does not have classes or instance methods. Instead, Elixir organizes code into modules and functions. This fundamental difference in structure allows Elixir code to be organized in a way that may seem unfamiliar to Ruby developers.</p>
<p>For instance, in Ruby, strings are instances of the String class, and you can call various instance methods on them using the <code>.-syntax</code>. In Elixir, however, there are no classes. Instead, String is a module that contains functions that operate on strings. To perform operations on a string in Elixir, you would use the syntax <code>String.function_name(string)</code>, rather than <code>string.function_name</code> as in Ruby.</p>
<p>Elixir also provides modules like Integer, List, and Float, each containing functions specific to their respective types. Additionally, when a function in Elixir requires multiple arguments, the first argument typically has the same type as the module itself.</p>
<p>If you're a Ruby developer looking to explore Elixir, it's essential to understand these key differences. While the syntax may appear similar, Elixir's functional nature and module-based structure offer a unique approach to coding. By embracing these differences, developers can fully leverage the power and capabilities of Elixir in their projects.</p>
<p>To get started with Elixir, follow the official installation instructions. Once installed, you can use <code>iex</code>, the Elixir equivalent of <code>irb</code>, to experiment with the language and explore its features.</p>
