		<p>Smol-dev-js is a new tool that allows developers to collaborate with their own personal AI developer. This tool is written entirely in JavaScript and can make both small and large changes to code, making it a valuable asset for developers who want to focus on the big picture while the AI handles the coding.</p>
<p>Think of smol-dev-js as pair-programming, but instead of working with another human, you are working with an AI developer. This allows you to switch roles and become the senior developer, instructing the AI on what to do. By treating the AI like a junior developer who is still learning the ropes, you can get better results as you prompt your way in a loop.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of smol-dev-js is that it allows you to focus on the sword fighting the big picture while the AI does the button mashing coding for you. This is not a no-code or low-code tool, but rather a third thing that allows you to make small incremental changes.</p>
<p>Because the changes are small and incremental, and run in a tight loop that you are in full control of, you don't need to worry about the AI going out of control like some autonomous agents. You can review each commit and revert them or make changes yourself if needed.</p>
<p>With smol-dev-js, you can direct development in a collaborative back-and-forth experience, generating a full project from specs or making small changes to a few lines of code. This tool is suitable for developers who want to keep up with the latest news in the industry and want to work more efficiently.</p>
<p>To get started with smol-dev-js, simply download the npm package and start collaborating with your own personal AI developer.</p>
