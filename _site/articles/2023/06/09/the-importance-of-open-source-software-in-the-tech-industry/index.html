		<p>Open source software has been the engine of innovation in the tech industry for quite some time, fostering a community of creators united by a shared ethos to build software for the benefit of all, free from the constraints of capitalization. Pioneers in this realm have gifted us transformative technologies like Linux, Git, Python, and MySQL, demonstrating the immense potential of open source. However, this vibrant landscape is losing its color, its once resounding hum now a mere whisper. The passion that fueled global innovation is fading, replaced by a new dynamic where open-source contributions are often seen as stepping stones for career advancement or talent scouting platforms for corporations.</p>
<p>The transition is subtle but profound. Today, free and open-source software (FOSS) contributions are frequently seen as resume builders for aspiring developers or hunting grounds for companies seeking talent. Open source, once a bastion of global innovation, now teeters on the brink of becoming a niche hobby. Despite its critical role in the tech industry, the situation for open source maintainers is dire. They are often overworked and underpaid, with little support from the industry. This has led to a hidden crisis in open source development, with many maintainers burning out and leaving the community.</p>
<p>As developers, it is important to recognize the value of open source software and the people who maintain it. We must support them by contributing to their projects, providing financial support, and advocating for their recognition and compensation. This will ensure that open source software continues to thrive and innovate, benefiting the entire tech industry.</p>
