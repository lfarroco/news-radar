		<p>When it comes to conditional moves, most developers are familiar with the x86 instruction cmov. However, there's an underrated feature of AArch64 ISA that is often overlooked but used by compilers a lot - csinc. In this article, we'll explore the power of csinc and why it's a hidden gem for developers.</p>
<p>First, let's take a step back and understand what conditional moves are. Conditional moves are instructions that allow you to conditionally set the value of a register based on a condition. This can be useful in low-level optimization, such as when merging two arrays. Traditionally, conditional moves are associated with the x86 instruction cmov.</p>
<p>However, AArch64 ISA has its own version of conditional moves - csinc. What makes csinc unique is its ability to perform a conditional increment or decrement in a single instruction. This can be incredibly useful in situations where you need to increment or decrement a value based on a condition.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example. Say we have a variable x and we want to increment it if y is greater than z. In C, we would write:</p>
<p>if (y &gt; z) {
x++;
}</p>
<p>In AArch64 assembly, we can use csinc to achieve the same result:</p>
<p>csinc w0, w0, wzr, gt</p>
<p>In this instruction, w0 is the destination register, w0 is the source register, wzr is the zero register, and gt is the condition code. If the condition gt is true (y &gt; z), then w0 is incremented. Otherwise, w0 remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Csinc can also be used to perform a conditional decrement. For example, if we want to decrement x if y is less than z, we can use the following instruction:</p>
<p>csinc w0, w0, wzr, lt</p>
<p>Csinc is not only useful for incrementing and decrementing values, but it can also be used to perform other operations based on a condition. For example, we can use csinc to perform a conditional move. Say we have two variables x and y, and we want to move the value of x into y if y is less than z. In AArch64 assembly, we can use the following instruction:</p>
<p>csinc x0, x1, x0, lt</p>
<p>In this instruction, x0 is the destination register, x1 is the source register, x0 is the value to be moved if the condition lt is true (y &lt; z).</p>
<p>Csinc may seem like a small feature, but it can have a big impact on performance. By allowing developers to perform conditional increments and decrements in a single instruction, csinc can help reduce the number of instructions needed to perform certain operations. This can lead to faster and more efficient code.</p>
<p>In conclusion, csinc is a hidden gem in AArch64 ISA that developers should be aware of. While it may not be as well-known as cmov, csinc's ability to perform conditional increments and decrements in a single instruction can be incredibly useful in low-level optimization. By taking advantage of csinc, developers can write faster and more efficient code.</p>
