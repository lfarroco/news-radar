		<p>Ivy is a new machine learning framework that aims to simplify the process of building and testing machine learning models. Developed by the team at Unified AI, Ivy is designed to be easy to use and flexible enough to handle a wide range of machine learning tasks.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Ivy is its support for multiple programming languages, including Python, Julia, and TypeScript. This makes it easy for developers to use Ivy with their preferred language and integrate it into their existing workflows.</p>
<p>In addition to its language support, Ivy also offers a number of built-in tools and utilities to help developers build and test their models. These include data loaders, model trainers, and visualization tools, as well as support for popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p>
<p>To get started with Ivy, developers can simply install the framework using pip or npm, depending on their preferred language. From there, they can use Ivy's intuitive API to build and test their models, with access to a wide range of built-in tools and utilities to help streamline the process.</p>
<p>Overall, Ivy is a promising new addition to the machine learning landscape, offering a powerful and flexible framework for building and testing machine learning models. With its support for multiple programming languages and built-in tools and utilities, Ivy is sure to be a valuable tool for developers looking to stay on the cutting edge of machine learning technology.</p>
