		<p>Modal text editors are gaining popularity among developers due to their unique approach to code editing. While some may question the need to invest time in mastering a complicated code editor, the benefits of using a modal text editor are undeniable.</p>
<p>Code editors are not just about editing code, but also about code navigation. With the vast amount of context that developers have to keep in mind, quickly navigating code can help refresh that context. Modal text editors allow users to switch between different modes, each with its own set of commands, making it easier to navigate and edit code.</p>
<p>One popular modal text editor is Kakoune, which offers a range of features including multiple selections, interactive search, and a client-server architecture. It also has a strong focus on customizability, allowing users to tailor the editor to their specific needs.</p>
<p>Modal text editing may seem daunting at first, but the time investment is worth it. As code editing takes up a significant portion of a developer's time, optimizing the process with better tools can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Additionally, investing in improving editing and navigating speed can benefit a developer's career in the long run.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while some may question the need for investing time in mastering a code editor, modal text editors offer unique benefits that can greatly improve a developer's workflow. With their focus on code navigation and customizability, modal text editors like Kakoune are paving the way for the future of code editing.</p>
