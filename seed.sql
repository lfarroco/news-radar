23	News from WWDC23: WebKit Features in Safari 17 beta	https://webkit.org/blog/14205/news-from-wwdc23-webkit-features-in-safari-17-beta/	published	reddit	 News from WWDC23: WebKit Features in Safari 17 beta Jun 6, 2023 by Patrick Angle, Jean-Yves Avenard, Marcos Caceres, Ada Rose Cannon, Eric Carlson, Garrett Davidson, Jon Davis, Karl Dubost, Brady Eidson, Matthew Finkel, Simon Fraser, Brent Fulgham, Rachel Ginsberg, David Johnson, Anne van Kesteren, Mark Lam, Sihui Liu, Justin Michaud, Jer Noble, Tim Nguyen, Ben Nham, Richard Robinson, Michael Saboff, Alexey Shvaika, Jen Simmons, Sam Sneddon, Brandon Stewart, John Wilander, Luming Yin ContentsWeb AppsSpatial WebImagesVideoHTMLCSSJavaScript and Web APIWeb Developer ToolsSecurityWebGLWebKit APIBrowser changesSafari ExtensionsBug Fixes and moreHelp us Beta TestFeedback It’s been a fantastic year for WebKit. We’ve shipped eight Safari releases since WWDC22, with more than 140 new web technologies in the first half of 2023 alone. Now, we are pleased to announce another 88 web features coming this fall in Safari 17.\nWeb Apps\nWeb apps are coming to Mac. With macOS Sonoma, you can add a website — any website — to your Dock. Just go to File > Add to Dock, adjust the name and icon if desired, and the web app icon appears in your Dock.\nWeb apps on Mac let you focus on the websites you use all the time, separate from the rest of your browsing. Like all Mac apps, web apps work great with Stage Manager, Mission Control, and keyboard shortcuts like Command + Tab. Web apps can be opened from the Dock, Launchpad, and Spotlight Search. Web apps work with AutoFill credentials from iCloud Keychain and from third-party apps that have adopted the Credential Provider Extension API. And users can grant permission to a web app to use their camera, microphone and location in the same way they grant such permissions to other Mac apps through system prompts and the Privacy & Security section of System Settings. Web apps on Mac support web push, badging, and all the usual web standards implemented by WebKit, just like web apps on iOS and iPadOS.\nWhen a user clicks on a web app icon, the website always opens in its own window as a web app, even if the site does not have a manifest file (or legacy meta tags). This expands the usefulness of web apps, putting users in charge of determining what becomes a web app and giving them the confidence it’s always something they can choose.\nWhile the default web app experience on Mac is great, as a web app developer you can use web technologies like Service Workers to make it even better. By providing a web app manifest, you can customize the presentation of your web app, including the display mode, name, theme color, and start URL. Learn about the details by watching What’s new in Web Apps at WWDC23.\nWhen a user adds a website to their Dock, Safari will copy the website’s cookies to the web app. That way, if someone is logged into their account in Safari, they will remain logged in within the web app. This will only work if the authentication state is stored within cookies. Safari does not copy over any other kind of local storage. After a user adds a web app to the Dock, no other website data is shared, which is great for privacy.\nAdd to Home Screen from Safari View Controller\nAdd to Home Screen is now available from Safari View Controller on iOS and iPadOS. Tapping a link within an app that uses Safari View Controller as the in-app browser allows the user to add the open website to their Home Screen right from there. Just like Add to Home Screen from Safari on iOS and iPadOS (or any other browser that implemented support), if the website has a manifest file with a display mode of standalone or fullscreen, it will open as a Home Screen web app.\nSpatial Web\nWe can’t wait for you to try out Safari on Vision Pro. This truly is Safari, with the same WebKit engine — plus a few additions. All of your websites will work beautifully out of the box, thanks to its extensive support for web standards. You can see exactly how Safari on Vision Pro works by watching the WWDC23 Keynote and Meet Safari for spatial computing.\nWe are collaborating on two technologies to make the web in spatial computing even more powerful — the <model> element and WebXR.\nModel\nThe <model> element will provide a way to easily present 3D content in a web page without any scripting. Just like with <img> and <video>, HTML makes it possible for <model> to work in a robust and simple manner across web browsers on any platform. Model is still undergoing standardization and is subject to change, but we expect it will work like this:\n<model src="asset/example-3d-model" width="400" height="300"></model>\nBy creating a declarative element, we can leverage well-known patterns for supporting multiple file formats, while simultaneously providing fallbacks for browsers without support.\n<model width="400" height="300" interactive> <source src="assets/example.usdz" type="model/vnd.usdz+zip"> <source src="assets/example.glb" type="model/gltf-binary"> <picture> <source src="fallback-version.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <source src="fallback-version.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="fallback-version.gif"/> </picture>\n</model>\nThe interactive attribute will enable user interaction and allow people to rotate the model in place. An accompanying JavaScript API will provide even more capabilities, including access to the camera. The exact details of how <model> will work are currently being debated at the Immersive Web Community Group.\nThe ability to embed rich 3D content into a web page will open up a world of possibilities. For example, an online shoe store might provide models of all their shoes. Or a website for interior design inspiration could provide furniture models for people to “place” virtually in their homes. Safari on Vision Pro will take such experiences to the next level, with a full stereoscopic view and environmental lighting — all in a privacy-preserving way. What or where the user is looking is never exposed to the web page.\nYou can try out <model> in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS by turning on its feature flag and navigating to this demo page.\nWebXR\nWhen embedding a 3D model into a web page isn’t enough, WebXR provides the technology for creating a fully immersive experience on the web. WebXR is based on WebGL, and many popular WebGL libraries already have built in support.\nSafari on Vision Pro currently has testable support for WebXR, available behind a feature flag while we collaborate with the W3C Immersive Web Working Group on updates to the web standard. WebKit supports the immersive-vr session type in WebXR. Vision Pro does not have external controllers. Instead, you can request the “hand-tracking” feature to let users interact with your content.\nVisit the Immersive Web Working Group developer page at immersiveweb.dev to learn more about getting started with different frameworks that include WebXR support and to find one that best fits your project.\nImages\nJPEG XL\nWe are pleased to announce that support for JPEG XL is coming to Safari 17. Similar to JPEG, the new image format provides another modern option for finding the right balance between quality and file size. JPEG XL uses a new compression algorithm called “Modular Entropy Coding” that allows for greater flexibility in adjusting the compression ratio. With support for progressive loading, it’s well suited for images served over slow connections, since users start to see the image before the whole file is downloaded. And you can recompress existing JPEG files into JPEG XL without any loss of data, while reducing their size by an average of 20%. Or compress from the original image file to create a file that’s up to 60% smaller compared to JPEG!\nUse the <picture> element to provide JPEG XL files to browsers that have support, while providing a fallback for browsers that don’t.\n<picture> <source srcset="images/large/sophie.jxl" type="image/jxl"> <img src="images/large/sophie.jpeg">\n</picture>\nJPEG XL will be supported by WebKit for Safari 17, Safari View Controller and WKWebView on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, as well as iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS.\nHEIC\nWe are also adding support for HEIC images to Safari 17, which uses the HEVC video codec compression algorithm. HEIC is the file format used on iPhone and iPad to store photos taken with the camera. With support for HEIC in Safari, Safari View Controller, and WKWebView, developers can support importing and editing such photos right in the browser, without needing to convert them into another format. HEIC is also ideal for displaying images when using WKWebView inside an app.\nImage set\nSafari 17 also improves our implementation of image-set(), increasing interoperability with other browsers as part of our commitment to Interop 2023 , and adding support for the optional resolution and type arguments. The type argument provides you with a means to offer browsers multiple image formats to choose from, including JPEG XL and HEIC.\n.component { background-image: image-set( url("images/trees.jxl") type("image/jxl"), url("images/trees.avif") type("image/avif"), url("images/trees.jpeg") type("image/jpeg") );\n}\nVideo\nManaged Media Source\nWebKit for Safari 17 also brings the new Managed Media Source API. It provides a power-efficient solution fulfilling advanced needs as a low-level toolkit for streaming video.\nAdaptive bitrate streaming allows for switching between media data formats — ensuring delivery of the best possible video quality based on the user’s internet connection speed and device capabilities, even as those conditions change. Media Source Extensions (MSE) is an existing low-level toolkit for adaptive streaming giving the web page more control and responsibilities for managing buffering and resolution. But MSE isn’t particularly good at managing buffer levels, network access, and media variant selection. And it uses a lot of power on mobile devices.\nManaged Media Source adds the capabilities of MSE, without any of the drawbacks. It’s available on iPadOS 17 beta and macOS Sonoma beta, and is in preview on iOS 17 beta, where it can be tested by turning on its feature flag. Note that Managed Media Source is only made available when an AirPlay source alternative is present.\nLearn more about JPEG XL, HEIC, and Managed Media Source API by watching Explore media formats for the web at WWDC23.\nMedia player stats overlay\nIf you’ve enabled Developer Features, WebKit now provides a media player stats overlay where you can see technical details about a video — its source type, size, performance metrics, resolution, codec string, and color configuration. To show the overlay, use the context menu on any <video> element and select “Show Media Stats”. Now you can tell at a glance the exact codec and configuration used by media on your page and use that information to craft accurate queries in MediaCapabilities.\nAnd more video\nWebKit now supports USB cameras on iPadOS 17. When a USB camera is attached to an iPad, it’s included in the output of enumerateDevices() and is selectable with getUserMedia() along with the built-in cameras.\nImprovements to WebRTC add support for InputDeviceInfo, the inbound rtp trackIdentifier stat field, exposing zoom in MediaTrackCapabilities, and getDisplayMedia video track clone resizing.\nWebKit for Safari 17 adds additional support for low-power mode — optimizing video streaming by tone mapping HDR video to SDR.\nHTML\nPopover\nSafari 17 adds support for the popover attribute. It provides a framework for displaying overlays, popups, popovers, and dialogs. There are two types of popovers, which can be used as values for the popover attribute:\nauto popovers, which automatically close when you click outside of the popover; and\nmanual popovers, which don’t have this automatic closing behavior.\nUse a button (either a <button> element or button input type) to create the UI for opening and closing the popover. And add the appropriate HTML attributes to create the desired result.\nThe popovertarget attribute connects the button to the popover content through an ID. The optional popovertargetaction attribute takes show, hide, or toggle as values. By default, toggle is used.\n<button popovertarget="info-box" popovertargetaction="show">More info</button>\n<article id="info-box" popover="auto"> <h2>Additional Information</h2> <p>Here’s something I wanted to tell you.</p> <button popovertarget="info-box" popovertargetaction="hide">Close</button>\n</article>\nThis is just one UI pattern you might find useful. There are many possible combinations. Having a popover mechanism in HTML makes for quick work, while ensuring great usability and full accessibility.\nTo go beyond a simple button trigger, a JavaScript API opens up more powerful possibilities through showPopover(), hidePopover(), and togglePopover().\nAnd more HTML\nSafari 17 on macOS adds support for <hr> inside of <select>, which is a feature the WebKit team added to the HTML Standard. This makes it easier to create a visual separator between items without requiring the use of JavaScript.\n<select> <option value="pizza">Pizza</option> <option value="hamburger">Hamburger</option> <hr> <option value="sushi">Ice cream</option> <option value="pasta">Cake</option>\n</select>\nThe <menu> element is now mapped to role=list. Slotted elements are now announced when inside <dialog> or aria-modal. And now slot elements referenced with aria-labelledby are properly labeled.\nCSS\nCounter styles\nSafari 17 adds support for CSS Counter Styles, providing a mechanism through @counter-style for changing a counter’s language or character set in CSS — both for ordered/unordered lists with list-style-type, and for CSS Counters.\n@counter-style upper-serbian { system: alphabetic; symbols: 'А' 'Б' 'В' 'Г' 'Д' 'Ђ' 'Е' 'Ж' 'З' 'И' 'Ј' 'К' 'Л' 'Љ' 'М' 'Н' 'Њ' 'О' 'П' 'Р' 'С' 'Т' 'Ћ' 'У' 'Ф' 'Х' 'Ц' 'Ч' 'Џ' 'Ш';\n}\nol { list-style: upper-serbian; }\nFont size adjust\nIn Safari 16.4, we shipped initial support for font-size-adjust, which allows you to easily make the visual size of different fonts consistent — even across all possible combinations of fallback fonts. The basic version of font-size-adjust lets you tell the browser to resize letters so that their x-height is a specific ratio of the font-size.\nIn Safari 17, we’re expanding support to include more advance capabilities of font-size-adjust, including the from-font value and two-value syntax. Instead of declaring a ratio with a number value, the from-font value allows you to ask the browser to pull the sizing metric from the main font being specified, and apply that ratio to all fonts. Two-value syntax lets you switch from adjusting ex-height to adjusting cap-height, ch-width, ic-width, or ic-height — providing support for a broader range of languages and design choices.\nLet’s look at an example. Here, font-size-adjust tells the browser to make all of the fonts inside article match the size of the x-height of the main font being used. This means all of the text in paragraphs and code will visually appear to be the same size, no matter which font is applied from either stack, or how different the paragraph and code fonts appear in actual size.\narticle { font-family: "Iowan Old Style", "Palatino Linotype", "URW Palladio L", P052, serif; font-size: 1.4rem; font-size-adjust: from-font;\n}\narticle code { font-family: "Courier New", monospace;\n}\nTo learn much more about how font-size-adjust works, as well as all about Counter Styles, watch What’s new in CSS at WWDC23.\nSafari 17 also brings support for @font-face size-adjust, which provides a way for you to normalize visual size when defining a font’s use.\nText transform\nSafari 17 adds support for text-transform: full-width and full-size-kana, and adds support for multiple text-transform values. The full-width value transforms all the characters in a string of text to be “full-width” — to match the size of characters in an East Asian script like those for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. It’s especially useful when wanting to improve consistency in sizing when typesetting CJK. The full-size-kana value transforms the size of Kana characters in Japanese to be full-size, rather than the typical small size — useful to make ruby text more legible when needed.\nFont support\nTo expand what’s possible with web typography, Safari 17 adds two feature queries for writing CSS depending on the presence or absence of browser support for font tech or format: @supports font-tech() as well as @supports font-format(). Font tech refers to specific kinds of OpenType technology used in some fonts, like COLRv0. Safari 17 also adds support for @font-face { src: url() tech() }, making it easy to define the use of a font that depends on newer tech, while providing a fallback for browsers without support.\n@font-face { font-family: "My Cool Font"; src: url("mycoolfont-COLRv0.otf") format(opentype) tech(color-COLRv0), url("mycoolfont-outline.otf") format(opentype);\n}\nMedia Queries 4\nSafari 17 rounds out support for Media Queries level 4, with support for two new media queries. Like the others, overflow-block and overflow-inline provide a way to conditionally apply CSS depending on the qualities of a user’s device — in this case, how the device handles overflow. For example, can it scroll the page like a typical browser on a computer? Does it page the content, like an e-book reader? Or does it have no mechanism for handling overflow, like a digital billboard?\nAnd more CSS\nWebKit for Safari 17 includes multiple fixes to improve accessibility of display: contents, including making aria-activedescendant, aria-dropeffect, aria-flowto, aria-grabbed, aria-owns, AXAccessKey, CSS speak-as, and URL AX APIs work on elements that have display: contents applied. As well as computing the accessible name for display: contents elements that rely on labels or captions, and making display: contents elements to be able to return selected accessibility children.\nSafari 17 also adds support for contain-intrinsic-size, providing a way to set the size of an element to use for layout when the element is subject to size containment.\nTo increase the usefulness of :has(), WebKit now supports :has(:buffering) and :has(:stalled) to expand the ability to apply CSS conditionally based on the state of media playback. And Safari 17 supports :has(:defined) for applying styling based on the presence of a custom element that has been defined.\nTo keep up with the most recent changes to the web standard for Container Queries, Safari 17 adds support for containerName and containerQuery, and updates conditionText to be containerName containerQuery in CSSContainerRule.\nJavaScript and Web API\nOffscreen Canvas\nWhen using Canvas, the rendering, animation, and user interaction usually happens on the main execution thread of a web application. Offscreen Canvas provides a canvas that can be rendered off-screen, decoupling the DOM and the Canvas API so that the <canvas> element is no longer entirely dependent on the DOM. Rendering can be transferred to a worker context, allowing you to run tasks in a separate thread and avoid heavy work on the main thread that can negatively impact the user experience. The combination of DOM-independent operations and rendering of the main thread can provide a significantly better experience for users, especially on low-power devices. Support for Offscreen Canvas 2D operations shipped in Safari 16.4. Now, Safari 17 adds support for 3D contexts in Offscreen Canvas.\nStorage\nWebKit has made some big updates to the storage quota policy. Previously, an origin had a starting storage limit of 1 GB. When exceeding the limit, the subsequent storage operation would fail in Home Screen web apps, or the user would see a prompt asking to increase the quota for the origin in Safari. Starting in macOS Sonoma, iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, the quota is calculated based on total disk space without the user’s input. The origin generally gets a much higher limit, and the user isn’t prompted in Safari. To get the estimated value of the current origin quota and usage, you can use the newly supported navigator.storage.estimate() method.\nAs each origin gets a higher storage limit by default, WebKit will evict data by origin when the total usage of all origins is bigger than a certain value, the “overall quota”, calculated based on total disk space. An origin is exempt from eviction when its storage mode is persistent. To check the storage mode of your origin, you can use navigator.storage.persisted(); to request the mode be changed to persistent, you can use navigator.storage.persist(). Critical bug fixes have been made to ensure the storage mode value is remembered across sessions, and eviction will count on it. The Storage API is now fully supported.\nRegEx\nSafari 17 adds JavaScript support for two new Regular Expression features, RegExp v flag with set notation + properties of strings and RegExp duplicate named capture groups. The RegExp v flag feature allows for the creation of regular expressions containing Unicode properties, including some multi-character Emoji sequences. It also allows for creating regular expressions with union, intersection, and subtraction set operations on character classes and collections of strings.\nThe Duplicate Named Capture Group feature enables the creation of regular expressions with named captures where more than one capture group uses the same name. This allows you to create regular expressions with intuitive group names where there is more than a one-way pattern to search. An example is creating one regular expression that can search data strings written in multiple ways, e.g. M/D/Y versus D-M-Y, while extracting the matched results with captured group names month, day, and year regardless of which string format was matched.\nSet Operations\nAnother new JavaScript feature adds several new Set operation methods, including intersection() and union() as well as comparison methods including difference(), isSubsetOf() and isSuperSetOf(). Together these new methods make Sets first class objects.\nconst setA = new Set(["apples", "oranges", "grapes"]);\nconst setB = new Set(["bananas", "grapes", "apples"]);\n// Union into single set!\nconst union = setA.union(setB);\n// Interection "apples" and "grapes"\nconst intersect = setA.intersection(setB);\n// Difference "oranges"\nconst diff = setA.difference(setB);\nAnd so on. Check out also the new .symmetricDifference() and .isDisjointFrom() methods, which open some interesting comparison possibilities.\nGamepad API\nWebKit for Safari 17 adds support for Gamepad.prototype.vibrationActuator. It enables “dual-rumble” haptic feedback on gamepads. The API allows you to check if “dual-rumble” is supported by the gamepad, as well as control the duration and magnitude of the haptic effect.\nconst [gamepad] = navigator.getGamepads();\nif (gamepad?.vibrationActuator?.canPlayEffectType("dual-rumble")) { const options = { duration: 1000, // 1 seconds startDelay: 0, // play now strongMagnitude: 0.5, // low-frequency vibration weakMagnitude: 0.2, // high-frequency vibration }; gamepad.vibrationActuator.playEffect("dual-rumble", options);\n}\nURL API\nTraditionally, to ensure you could parse a URL, you needed to use a try sequence. Now, you can directly detect if an URL input can be parsed with URL.canParse(tentativeURL, optionalBase). The method will return true or false.\nIn addition, the has() and delete() methods on URLSearchParams have been extended. The has() method makes it possible to detect if a parameter has been set. And the delete() method can delete a parameter. Until now, you could only check for, and delete, by name alone. Now, the methods have been extended so that you can check for, and delete, specific name-value pairs.\nFor example, the following URL has currency as a duplicate key: https://example.com/?currency=USD&currency=JPY, before you could only check params.has('currency'). It is now possible to do: params.has('currency', 'JPY').\nBe mindful that with this update, method signatures are not directly feature detectable, so they can return false positives. Until all browsers support these updates, be sure to run a small test to confirm support. For example:\n// These return true only when the updated API is supported!\nfunction supportsUpdatedURLHasMethod() { const param = new URLSearchParams({ key: "value" }); return param.has("key", "does not exist") === false;\n}\nfunction supportsUpdatedURLDeleteMethod() { const param = new URLSearchParams({ key: "value" }); param.delete("key", "does not exist"); return param.has("key");\n}\nWeb Sockets\nYou can now use relative URLs (as well as HTTP(S) URLs) in the WebSocket constructor — this makes it a lot easier to point to WebSocket endpoints without hard-coding URLs into your web application. For example, new WebSocket('/updates').\nAnd more JavaScript and Web API\nSupport for <link rel="modulepreload">. Support for the focus fixup rule. Support for Ed25519 cryptography. Support for pausing and resuming background fetches. Support for ReadableStream. Support for fetch priority hints. Support for customElements.getName method.\nWeb Developer Tools\nRedesigned Develop Menu\nIn Safari 17 on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, a completely redesigned Develop menu makes it easier to find the key tools available to help you create websites, web apps, web content inside other apps, web extensions, and more.\nDevices and simulators are now more prominent in the Develop menu, making them easier to identify at a glance. Inside the menu for each iOS or iPadOS device, app icons make it easier to find the application or web content you want to inspect. On macOS Sonoma you can pair with Apple TV and Vision Pro directly from Safari to inspect those platforms.\nRethought Feature Flags\nThe new Feature Flags panel replaces the previous Experimental Features section of the Develop menu, allowing you to search for specific features and to easily see bolded features toggled from their default state. Feature flags are now organized by topic: Animation, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Media and more. And each feature is clearly categorized into one of four statuses: Stable, Testable, Preview, and Developer.\nStable represents features that have recently shipped in Safari, on by default. These features can be turned off to help you debug an issue or test progressive enhancements. Stable features will eventually be removed from the list.\nTestable features are disabled by default. These features might be in the process of being implemented, or they might be waiting for changes to the web standards. They have a ways to go, but still could be interesting enough to test out.\nPreview is for features that have not yet shipped in Safari, but are closer to being complete. These features are on by default in Safari Technology Preview, and are ready for developers to try out. They may still have bugs, or may even undergo significant change as web standards evolve. This is a great time to help find and file bugs, and to comment on whether the web standard for a new technologies solves your needs.\nDeveloper features are not as common. This category is for miscellaneous features added to the list of feature flags so developers can toggle them on and off for testing. Developer tools may appear here, for example.\nNew Developer settings panel\nThe new Developer panel in Safari 17’s Settings let you toggle developer features that apply across all websites open in Safari, like Allow remote automation (which enables automating Safari with WebDriver) and other features that were previously in the Develop menu.\nNew tab-specific setting overlay\nSome previously-global settings from the Develop menu, like disabling CSS or changing WebRTC behavior, have moved to Web Inspector where they are now scoped to the inspected tab, allowing you to use other tabs and windows normally.\nRedesigned Responsive Web Design Mode\nResponsive Design Mode has also been refreshed to focus on the responsiveness of a page’s design at any width or height on your Mac. You can type in a specific viewport size at the top of Responsive Design Mode in addition to dragging the resize handles around the view.\nAlso new is the ability to open the page in a Simulator right from Responsive Design Mode.\nSimulators\nYou can also open any page from Safari in a Simulator directly from the Develop > Open Page With menu, even when you are not using Responsive Design Mode.\nUsing a Simulator is a great way to test the experiences you’re making on iOS, iPadOS, and coming soon, visionOS — including device-specific behaviors, like the rendered size of type, the effects of the viewport meta tag, double-tap to zoom, and even Home Screen web apps on iOS and iPadOS. Simulators are free, and come included with Xcode from the Mac App Store.\nIf you don’t have Xcode installed, a link to documentation is conveniently available in the Develop > Open Page With menu, as well as the Open with Simulator menu in Responsive Design Mode, to help you get started, or to add more devices and OS versions.\nLearn all about the new Develop menu, redesigned Responsive Web Design mode, how to easily connect to directly to a real device, how to install and use a Simulator, and much more in Rediscover Safari developer features at WWDC23.\nWeb Inspector\nWe’ve also made improvements to Web Inspector. When working with minified sources, pretty printing in Web Inspector can help make the code easier to read, set breakpoints in, and debug. New in Safari 17, more JavaScript syntax is supported for pretty printing minified scripts, including template strings, optional chaining, private variables and functions in classes, and static variables and functions.\nChanges to Web Inspector in Safari 17 also include:\nElements tab: Added settings to always show rulers and element overlays for grid and flexbox when highlighting elements in Web Inspector or in Element Selection Mode.\nElements tab: Added editing controls for variation axes in the Fonts sidebar.\nConsole tab: Added setting to show timestamps for console messages.\nConsole tab: Added support for viewing the target of a WeakRef.\nSources tab: Added support for ES2022 Private Fields when inspecting and logging JavaScript objects.\nGraphics tab: Added support for OffscreenCanvas.\nLearn more by watching What’s new in Web Inspector at WWDC23.\nSecurity\nGPU Process\nLast year brought GPU process support to WebKit on iOS, iPadOS and watchOS. This year we’re adding support on macOS Sonoma. The change moves all drawing (including the drawing of page content, 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering) so it occurs in the “GPU Process”. This new architecture allows WebKit to isolate powerful graphics hardware and driver access away from the WebContent process, which is the process that interacts with untrusted content from the Internet. The new design also allows the WebContent process sandbox to completely block IOKit access, resulting in improved security.\nWebGL\nImprovements to WebGL include adding support for WEBGL_clip_cull_distance, EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2, EXT_polygon_offset_clamp and GPUExternalTexture.\nWebKit API\nNew interfaces are added to WKWebsiteDataStore and related classes to further unlock the potential of your WebKit apps. The new capabilities include creating persistent website data stores, configuring cookie policy, customizing proxy settings, requesting HTTPS upgrade for all navigations, and controlling state of inline prediction for autocomplete.\nBrowser changes\nSafari Profiles\nSafari 17 adds support for profiles. History, favorites, Tab Groups and website data such as cookies, caches, service workers, and Web Push subscriptions are scoped per-profile. Users can manage each profile’s data individually.\nSafari Private Browsing\nIn Safari 17, Private Browsing gets even more private with added protection against some of the most advanced techniques used to track you. Technical changes include:\nAdding blocking for known trackers and fingerprinting. Adding support for mitigating trackers that map subdomains to third-party IP addresses. Adding blocking for known tracking query parameters in links.\nAdding noise to fingerprintable web APIs.\nAdding console log messages when blocking requests to known trackers. Adding support for blocking trackers that use third-party CNAME cloaking.\nAdding support for Private Click Measurement for direct response advertising, similar to how it works for in-app direct response advertising.\nText cursor color\nOn macOS Sonoma, the redesigned text cursor now uses the system accent color and matches iOS behavior. You can still customize the color with the caret-color CSS property.\nLive Text\nSafari 17 adds support for vertical text recognition in images and videos.\nApple Pay via Payment Request API\nYou can now enable Apple Pay to be used in third-party iframes by setting the allow="payment" attribute. This “permissions policy” enables the Payment Request API on an iframe, allowing you to embed third-party payment handlers. If using this feature, be sure you also use the X-Frames-Options HTTP header to prevent your site from being embedded by malicious websites.\nAuthentication\nSafari 17 adds support for largeBlob extension for passkeys. Websites can use the additional storage to save data that can later be retrieved when signing in with a passkey. These saved blobs are synced and shared along with passkeys.\nWe also are adding support for enterprise WebAuthn attestation for passkeys in iCloud Keychain. Managed devices can provide an attestation statement when creating passkeys, using a certificate provisioned through MDM.\nNetworking\nSafari 17 adds support for preconnect via HTTP Early Hints.\nLockdown mode\nLockdown mode now:\nDisables IndexedDB.\nDisables the File API and FileReader API.\nDisables support for the <embed> element. Disables the Web Speech (Speech Synthesis) API.\nDisables the WebLocks API.\nDisables support for experimental APIs. Supports select web fonts.\nLockdown Mode is also now supported in WebKit on watchOS.\nSafari Extensions\nSafari 17 now lets you customize where extensions run with even more granularity.\nFirst, Safari App Extensions now have the same per-site permissions model as Safari Web Extensions. It puts users in control over the browsing data they share with every extension they use in Safari.\nSecond, as an additional layer of control, Safari Extensions can be turned off in Private Browsing. Extensions that access browsing data, like browsing history or webpage contents, will be off by default in Private Browsing but can be allowed with a single toggle in Safari Settings.\nThird, all Safari Extensions can be turned on or off per Safari Profile. You can imagine this being useful for turning on an extension used only for school or work in a relevant profile, but keeping it off everywhere else. Each profile runs a separate instance of the extension — meaning there are unique storage areas, background pages, service workers, and more. However, per-site permissions are shared across profiles, so an extension only needs to be granted once. If your extension leverages native messaging capabilities to communicate with a host app, it’s possible to distinguish between profiles to ensure your extension behaves correctly across profiles.\nLearn more by watching What’s new in Safari extensions at WWDC23.\nBug Fixes and more\nTo learn even more about what’s in Safari 17 for web developers, including an extensive list of bug fixes, read the Safari 17 beta release notes.\nHelp us Beta Test\nYou can test Safari 17 beta by installing the beta of macOS Sonoma, iOS 17, or iPadOS 17.\nOr, if you’d like, you can try out Safari 17 beta on macOS Ventura or macOS Monterey by downloading the Safari 17.0 public beta, once it’s available later this summer.

PreviouslyWeb technology sessions at WWDC23Learn more News from WWDC23: WebKit Features in Safari 17 betaJun 6, 2023by Patrick Angle, Jean-Yves Avenard, Marcos Caceres, Ada Rose Cannon, Eric Carlson, Garrett Davidson, Jon Davis, Karl Dubost, Brady Eidson, Matthew Finkel, Simon Fraser, Brent Fulgham, Rachel Ginsberg, David Johnson, Anne van Kesteren, Mark Lam, Sihui Liu, Justin Michaud, Jer Noble, Tim Nguyen, Ben Nham, Richard Robinson, Michael Saboff, Alexey Shvaika, Jen Simmons, Sam Sneddon, Brandon Stewart, John Wilander, Luming YinIt’s been a fantastic year for WebKit. We’ve shipped eight Safari releases since WWDC22, with more than 140 new web technologies in the first half of 2023 alone. Now, we are pleased to announce another 88 web features coming this fall in Safari 17.Web AppsWeb apps are coming to Mac. With macOS Sonoma, you can add a website — any website — to your Dock. Just go to File > Add to Dock, adjust the name and icon if desired, and the web app icon appears in your Dock.Web apps on Mac let you focus on the websites you use all the time, separate from the rest of your browsing. Like all Mac apps, web apps work great with Stage Manager, Mission Control, and keyboard shortcuts like Command + Tab. Web apps can be opened from the Dock, Launchpad, and Spotlight Search. Web apps work with AutoFill credentials from iCloud Keychain and from third-party apps that have adopted the Credential Provider Extension API. And users can grant permission to a web app to use their camera, microphone and location in the same way they grant such permissions to other Mac apps through system prompts and the Privacy & Security section of System Settings. Web apps on Mac support web push, badging, and all the usual web standards implemented by WebKit, just like web apps on iOS and iPadOS.When a user clicks on a web app icon, the website always opens in its own window as a web app, even if the site does not have a manifest file (or legacy meta tags). This expands the usefulness of web apps, putting users in charge of determining what becomes a web app and giving them the confidence it’s always something they can choose.While the default web app experience on Mac is great, as a web app developer you can use web technologies like Service Workers to make it even better. By providing a web app manifest, you can customize the presentation of your web app, including the display mode, name, theme color, and start URL. Learn about the details by watching What’s new in Web Apps at WWDC23.When a user adds a website to their Dock, Safari will copy the website’s cookies to the web app. That way, if someone is logged into their account in Safari, they will remain logged in within the web app. This will only work if the authentication state is stored within cookies. Safari does not copy over any other kind of local storage. After a user adds a web app to the Dock, no other website data is shared, which is great for privacy.Add to Home Screen from Safari View ControllerAdd to Home Screen is now available from Safari View Controller on iOS and iPadOS. Tapping a link within an app that uses Safari View Controller as the in-app browser allows the user to add the open website to their Home Screen right from there. Just like Add to Home Screen from Safari on iOS and iPadOS (or any other browser that implemented support), if the website has a manifest file with a display mode of standalone or fullscreen, it will open as a Home Screen web app.Spatial WebWe can’t wait for you to try out Safari on Vision Pro. This truly is Safari, with the same WebKit engine — plus a few additions. All of your websites will work beautifully out of the box, thanks to its extensive support for web standards. You can see exactly how Safari on Vision Pro works by watching the WWDC23 Keynote and Meet Safari for spatial computing.We are collaborating on two technologies to make the web in spatial computing even more powerful — the <model> element and WebXR.ModelThe <model> element will provide a way to easily present 3D content in a web page without any scripting. Just like with <img> and <video>, HTML makes it possible for <model> to work in a robust and simple manner across web browsers on any platform. Model is still undergoing standardization and is subject to change, but we expect it will work like this:By creating a declarative element, we can leverage well-known patterns for supporting multiple file formats, while simultaneously providing fallbacks for browsers without support.The interactive attribute will enable user interaction and allow people to rotate the model in place. An accompanying JavaScript API will provide even more capabilities, including access to the camera. The exact details of how <model> will work are currently being debated at the Immersive Web Community Group.The ability to embed rich 3D content into a web page will open up a world of possibilities. For example, an online shoe store might provide models of all their shoes. Or a website for interior design inspiration could provide furniture models for people to “place” virtually in their homes. Safari on Vision Pro will take such experiences to the next level, with a full stereoscopic view and environmental lighting — all in a privacy-preserving way. What or where the user is looking is never exposed to the web page.You can try out <model> in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS by turning on its feature flag and navigating to this demo page.WebXRWhen embedding a 3D model into a web page isn’t enough, WebXR provides the technology for creating a fully immersive experience on the web. WebXR is based on WebGL, and many popular WebGL libraries already have built in support.Safari on Vision Pro currently has testable support for WebXR, available behind a feature flag while we collaborate with the W3C Immersive Web Working Group on updates to the web standard. WebKit supports the immersive-vr session type in WebXR. Vision Pro does not have external controllers. Instead, you can request the “hand-tracking” feature to let users interact with your content.Visit the Immersive Web Working Group developer page at immersiveweb.dev to learn more about getting started with different frameworks that include WebXR support and to find one that best fits your project.ImagesJPEG XLWe are pleased to announce that support for JPEG XL is coming to Safari 17. Similar to JPEG, the new image format provides another modern option for finding the right balance between quality and file size. JPEG XL uses a new compression algorithm called “Modular Entropy Coding” that allows for greater flexibility in adjusting the compression ratio. With support for progressive loading, it’s well suited for images served over slow connections, since users start to see the image before the whole file is downloaded. And you can recompress existing JPEG files into JPEG XL without any loss of data, while reducing their size by an average of 20%. Or compress from the original image file to create a file that’s up to 60% smaller compared to JPEG!Use the <picture> element to provide JPEG XL files to browsers that have support, while providing a fallback for browsers that don’t.JPEG XL will be supported by WebKit for Safari 17, Safari View Controller and WKWebView on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, as well as iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS.HEICWe are also adding support for HEIC images to Safari 17, which uses the HEVC video codec compression algorithm. HEIC is the file format used on iPhone and iPad to store photos taken with the camera. With support for HEIC in Safari, Safari View Controller, and WKWebView, developers can support importing and editing such photos right in the browser, without needing to convert them into another format. HEIC is also ideal for displaying images when using WKWebView inside an app.Image setSafari 17 also improves our implementation of image-set(), increasing interoperability with other browsers as part of our commitment to Interop 2023 , and adding support for the optional resolution and type arguments. The type argument provides you with a means to offer browsers multiple image formats to choose from, including JPEG XL and HEIC.VideoManaged Media SourceWebKit for Safari 17 also brings the new Managed Media Source API. It provides a power-efficient solution fulfilling advanced needs as a low-level toolkit for streaming video.Adaptive bitrate streaming allows for switching between media data formats — ensuring delivery of the best possible video quality based on the user’s internet connection speed and device capabilities, even as those conditions change. Media Source Extensions (MSE) is an existing low-level toolkit for adaptive streaming giving the web page more control and responsibilities for managing buffering and resolution. But MSE isn’t particularly good at managing buffer levels, network access, and media variant selection. And it uses a lot of power on mobile devices.Managed Media Source adds the capabilities of MSE, without any of the drawbacks. It’s available on iPadOS 17 beta and macOS Sonoma beta, and is in preview on iOS 17 beta, where it can be tested by turning on its feature flag. Note that Managed Media Source is only made available when an AirPlay source alternative is present.Learn more about JPEG XL, HEIC, and Managed Media Source API by watching Explore media formats for the web at WWDC23.Media player stats overlayIf you’ve enabled Developer Features, WebKit now provides a media player stats overlay where you can see technical details about a video — its source type, size, performance metrics, resolution, codec string, and color configuration. To show the overlay, use the context menu on any <video> element and select “Show Media Stats”. Now you can tell at a glance the exact codec and configuration used by media on your page and use that information to craft accurate queries in MediaCapabilities.And more videoWebKit now supports USB cameras on iPadOS 17. When a USB camera is attached to an iPad, it’s included in the output of enumerateDevices() and is selectable with getUserMedia() along with the built-in cameras.Improvements to WebRTC add support for InputDeviceInfo, the inbound rtp trackIdentifier stat field, exposing zoom in MediaTrackCapabilities, and getDisplayMedia video track clone resizing.WebKit for Safari 17 adds additional support for low-power mode — optimizing video streaming by tone mapping HDR video to SDR.HTMLPopoverSafari 17 adds support for the popover attribute. It provides a framework for displaying overlays, popups, popovers, and dialogs. There are two types of popovers, which can be used as values for the popover attribute:Use a button (either a <button> element or button input type) to create the UI for opening and closing the popover. And add the appropriate HTML attributes to create the desired result.The popovertarget attribute connects the button to the popover content through an ID. The optional popovertargetaction attribute takes show, hide, or toggle as values. By default, toggle is used.This is just one UI pattern you might find useful. There are many possible combinations. Having a popover mechanism in HTML makes for quick work, while ensuring great usability and full accessibility.To go beyond a simple button trigger, a JavaScript API opens up more powerful possibilities through showPopover(), hidePopover(), and togglePopover().And more HTMLSafari 17 on macOS adds support for <hr> inside of <select>, which is a feature the WebKit team added to the HTML Standard. This makes it easier to create a visual separator between items without requiring the use of JavaScript.The <menu> element is now mapped to role=list. Slotted elements are now announced when inside <dialog> or aria-modal. And now slot elements referenced with aria-labelledby are properly labeled.CSSCounter stylesSafari 17 adds support for CSS Counter Styles, providing a mechanism through @counter-style for changing a counter’s language or character set in CSS — both for ordered/unordered lists with list-style-type, and for CSS Counters.Font size adjustIn Safari 16.4, we shipped initial support for font-size-adjust, which allows you to easily make the visual size of different fonts consistent — even across all possible combinations of fallback fonts. The basic version of font-size-adjust lets you tell the browser to resize letters so that their x-height is a specific ratio of the font-size.In Safari 17, we’re expanding support to include more advance capabilities of font-size-adjust, including the from-font value and two-value syntax. Instead of declaring a ratio with a number value, the from-font value allows you to ask the browser to pull the sizing metric from the main font being specified, and apply that ratio to all fonts. Two-value syntax lets you switch from adjusting ex-height to adjusting cap-height, ch-width, ic-width, or ic-height — providing support for a broader range of languages and design choices.Let’s look at an example. Here, font-size-adjust tells the browser to make all of the fonts inside article match the size of the x-height of the main font being used. This means all of the text in paragraphs and code will visually appear to be the same size, no matter which font is applied from either stack, or how different the paragraph and code fonts appear in actual size.To learn much more about how font-size-adjust works, as well as all about Counter Styles, watch What’s new in CSS at WWDC23.Safari 17 also brings support for @font-face size-adjust, which provides a way for you to normalize visual size when defining a font’s use.Text transformSafari 17 adds support for text-transform: full-width and full-size-kana, and adds support for multiple text-transform values. The full-width value transforms all the characters in a string of text to be “full-width” — to match the size of characters in an East Asian script like those for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. It’s especially useful when wanting to improve consistency in sizing when typesetting CJK. The full-size-kana value transforms the size of Kana characters in Japanese to be full-size, rather than the typical small size — useful to make ruby text more legible when needed.Font supportTo expand what’s possible with web typography, Safari 17 adds two feature queries for writing CSS depending on the presence or absence of browser support for font tech or format: @supports font-tech() as well as @supports font-format(). Font tech refers to specific kinds of OpenType technology used in some fonts, like COLRv0. Safari 17 also adds support for @font-face { src: url() tech() }, making it easy to define the use of a font that depends on newer tech, while providing a fallback for browsers without support.Media Queries 4Safari 17 rounds out support for Media Queries level 4, with support for two new media queries. Like the others, overflow-block and overflow-inline provide a way to conditionally apply CSS depending on the qualities of a user’s device — in this case, how the device handles overflow. For example, can it scroll the page like a typical browser on a computer? Does it page the content, like an e-book reader? Or does it have no mechanism for handling overflow, like a digital billboard?And more CSSWebKit for Safari 17 includes multiple fixes to improve accessibility of display: contents, including making aria-activedescendant, aria-dropeffect, aria-flowto, aria-grabbed, aria-owns, AXAccessKey, CSS speak-as, and URL AX APIs work on elements that have display: contents applied. As well as computing the accessible name for display: contents elements that rely on labels or captions, and making display: contents elements to be able to return selected accessibility children.Safari 17 also adds support for contain-intrinsic-size, providing a way to set the size of an element to use for layout when the element is subject to size containment.To increase the usefulness of :has(), WebKit now supports :has(:buffering) and :has(:stalled) to expand the ability to apply CSS conditionally based on the state of media playback. And Safari 17 supports :has(:defined) for applying styling based on the presence of a custom element that has been defined.To keep up with the most recent changes to the web standard for Container Queries, Safari 17 adds support for containerName and containerQuery, and updates conditionText to be containerName containerQuery in CSSContainerRule.JavaScript and Web APIOffscreen CanvasWhen using Canvas, the rendering, animation, and user interaction usually happens on the main execution thread of a web application. Offscreen Canvas provides a canvas that can be rendered off-screen, decoupling the DOM and the Canvas API so that the <canvas> element is no longer entirely dependent on the DOM. Rendering can be transferred to a worker context, allowing you to run tasks in a separate thread and avoid heavy work on the main thread that can negatively impact the user experience. The combination of DOM-independent operations and rendering of the main thread can provide a significantly better experience for users, especially on low-power devices. Support for Offscreen Canvas 2D operations shipped in Safari 16.4. Now, Safari 17 adds support for 3D contexts in Offscreen Canvas.StorageWebKit has made some big updates to the storage quota policy. Previously, an origin had a starting storage limit of 1 GB. When exceeding the limit, the subsequent storage operation would fail in Home Screen web apps, or the user would see a prompt asking to increase the quota for the origin in Safari. Starting in macOS Sonoma, iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, the quota is calculated based on total disk space without the user’s input. The origin generally gets a much higher limit, and the user isn’t prompted in Safari. To get the estimated value of the current origin quota and usage, you can use the newly supported navigator.storage.estimate() method.As each origin gets a higher storage limit by default, WebKit will evict data by origin when the total usage of all origins is bigger than a certain value, the “overall quota”, calculated based on total disk space. An origin is exempt from eviction when its storage mode is persistent. To check the storage mode of your origin, you can use navigator.storage.persisted(); to request the mode be changed to persistent, you can use navigator.storage.persist(). Critical bug fixes have been made to ensure the storage mode value is remembered across sessions, and eviction will count on it. The Storage API is now fully supported.RegExSafari 17 adds JavaScript support for two new Regular Expression features, RegExp v flag with set notation + properties of strings and RegExp duplicate named capture groups. The RegExp v flag feature allows for the creation of regular expressions containing Unicode properties, including some multi-character Emoji sequences. It also allows for creating regular expressions with union, intersection, and subtraction set operations on character classes and collections of strings.The Duplicate Named Capture Group feature enables the creation of regular expressions with named captures where more than one capture group uses the same name. This allows you to create regular expressions with intuitive group names where there is more than a one-way pattern to search. An example is creating one regular expression that can search data strings written in multiple ways, e.g. M/D/Y versus D-M-Y, while extracting the matched results with captured group names month, day, and year regardless of which string format was matched.Set OperationsAnother new JavaScript feature adds several new Set operation methods, including intersection() and union() as well as comparison methods including difference(), isSubsetOf() and isSuperSetOf(). Together these new methods make Sets first class objects.And so on. Check out also the new .symmetricDifference() and .isDisjointFrom() methods, which open some interesting comparison possibilities.Gamepad APIWebKit for Safari 17 adds support for Gamepad.prototype.vibrationActuator. It enables “dual-rumble” haptic feedback on gamepads. The API allows you to check if “dual-rumble” is supported by the gamepad, as well as control the duration and magnitude of the haptic effect.URL APITraditionally, to ensure you could parse a URL, you needed to use a try sequence. Now, you can directly detect if an URL input can be parsed with URL.canParse(tentativeURL, optionalBase). The method will return true or false.In addition, the has() and delete() methods on URLSearchParams have been extended. The has() method makes it possible to detect if a parameter has been set. And the delete() method can delete a parameter. Until now, you could only check for, and delete, by name alone. Now, the methods have been extended so that you can check for, and delete, specific name-value pairs.For example, the following URL has currency as a duplicate key: https://example.com/?currency=USD&currency=JPY, before you could only check params.has('currency'). It is now possible to do: params.has('currency', 'JPY').Be mindful that with this update, method signatures are not directly feature detectable, so they can return false positives. Until all browsers support these updates, be sure to run a small test to confirm support. For example:Web SocketsYou can now use relative URLs (as well as HTTP(S) URLs) in the WebSocket constructor — this makes it a lot easier to point to WebSocket endpoints without hard-coding URLs into your web application. For example, new WebSocket('/updates').And more JavaScript and Web APIWeb Developer ToolsRedesigned Develop MenuIn Safari 17 on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, a completely redesigned Develop menu makes it easier to find the key tools available to help you create websites, web apps, web content inside other apps, web extensions, and more.Devices and simulators are now more prominent in the Develop menu, making them easier to identify at a glance. Inside the menu for each iOS or iPadOS device, app icons make it easier to find the application or web content you want to inspect. On macOS Sonoma you can pair with Apple TV and Vision Pro directly from Safari to inspect those platforms.Rethought Feature FlagsThe new Feature Flags panel replaces the previous Experimental Features section of the Develop menu, allowing you to search for specific features and to easily see bolded features toggled from their default state. Feature flags are now organized by topic: Animation, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Media and more. And each feature is clearly categorized into one of four statuses: Stable, Testable, Preview, and Developer.Stable represents features that have recently shipped in Safari, on by default. These features can be turned off to help you debug an issue or test progressive enhancements. Stable features will eventually be removed from the list.Testable features are disabled by default. These features might be in the process of being implemented, or they might be waiting for changes to the web standards. They have a ways to go, but still could be interesting enough to test out.Preview is for features that have not yet shipped in Safari, but are closer to being complete. These features are on by default in Safari Technology Preview, and are ready for developers to try out. They may still have bugs, or may even undergo significant change as web standards evolve. This is a great time to help find and file bugs, and to comment on whether the web standard for a new technologies solves your needs.Developer features are not as common. This category is for miscellaneous features added to the list of feature flags so developers can toggle them on and off for testing. Developer tools may appear here, for example.New Developer settings panelThe new Developer panel in Safari 17’s Settings let you toggle developer features that apply across all websites open in Safari, like Allow remote automation (which enables automating Safari with WebDriver) and other features that were previously in the Develop menu.New tab-specific setting overlaySome previously-global settings from the Develop menu, like disabling CSS or changing WebRTC behavior, have moved to Web Inspector where they are now scoped to the inspected tab, allowing you to use other tabs and windows normally.Redesigned Responsive Web Design ModeResponsive Design Mode has also been refreshed to focus on the responsiveness of a page’s design at any width or height on your Mac. You can type in a specific viewport size at the top of Responsive Design Mode in addition to dragging the resize handles around the view.Also new is the ability to open the page in a Simulator right from Responsive Design Mode.SimulatorsYou can also open any page from Safari in a Simulator directly from the Develop > Open Page With menu, even when you are not using Responsive Design Mode.Using a Simulator is a great way to test the experiences you’re making on iOS, iPadOS, and coming soon, visionOS — including device-specific behaviors, like the rendered size of type, the effects of the viewport meta tag, double-tap to zoom, and even Home Screen web apps on iOS and iPadOS. Simulators are free, and come included with Xcode from the Mac App Store.If you don’t have Xcode installed, a link to documentation is conveniently available in the Develop > Open Page With menu, as well as the Open with Simulator menu in Responsive Design Mode, to help you get started, or to add more devices and OS versions.Learn all about the new Develop menu, redesigned Responsive Web Design mode, how to easily connect to directly to a real device, how to install and use a Simulator, and much more in Rediscover Safari developer features at WWDC23.Web InspectorWe’ve also made improvements to Web Inspector. When working with minified sources, pretty printing in Web Inspector can help make the code easier to read, set breakpoints in, and debug. New in Safari 17, more JavaScript syntax is supported for pretty printing minified scripts, including template strings, optional chaining, private variables and functions in classes, and static variables and functions.Changes to Web Inspector in Safari 17 also include:Learn more by watching What’s new in Web Inspector at WWDC23.SecurityGPU ProcessLast year brought GPU process support to WebKit on iOS, iPadOS and watchOS. This year we’re adding support on macOS Sonoma. The change moves all drawing (including the drawing of page content, 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering) so it occurs in the “GPU Process”. This new architecture allows WebKit to isolate powerful graphics hardware and driver access away from the WebContent process, which is the process that interacts with untrusted content from the Internet. The new design also allows the WebContent process sandbox to completely block IOKit access, resulting in improved security.WebGLImprovements to WebGL include adding support for WEBGL_clip_cull_distance, EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2, EXT_polygon_offset_clamp and GPUExternalTexture.WebKit APINew interfaces are added to WKWebsiteDataStore and related classes to further unlock the potential of your WebKit apps. The new capabilities include creating persistent website data stores, configuring cookie policy, customizing proxy settings, requesting HTTPS upgrade for all navigations, and controlling state of inline prediction for autocomplete.Browser changesSafari ProfilesSafari 17 adds support for profiles. History, favorites, Tab Groups and website data such as cookies, caches, service workers, and Web Push subscriptions are scoped per-profile. Users can manage each profile’s data individually.Safari Private BrowsingIn Safari 17, Private Browsing gets even more private with added protection against some of the most advanced techniques used to track you. Technical changes include:Text cursor colorOn macOS Sonoma, the redesigned text cursor now uses the system accent color and matches iOS behavior. You can still customize the color with the caret-color CSS property.Live TextSafari 17 adds support for vertical text recognition in images and videos.Apple Pay via Payment Request APIYou can now enable Apple Pay to be used in third-party iframes by setting the allow="payment" attribute. This “permissions policy” enables the Payment Request API on an iframe, allowing you to embed third-party payment handlers. If using this feature, be sure you also use the X-Frames-Options HTTP header to prevent your site from being embedded by malicious websites.AuthenticationSafari 17 adds support for largeBlob extension for passkeys. Websites can use the additional storage to save data that can later be retrieved when signing in with a passkey. These saved blobs are synced and shared along with passkeys.We also are adding support for enterprise WebAuthn attestation for passkeys in iCloud Keychain. Managed devices can provide an attestation statement when creating passkeys, using a certificate provisioned through MDM.NetworkingSafari 17 adds support for preconnect via HTTP Early Hints.Lockdown modeLockdown mode now:Lockdown Mode is also now supported in WebKit on watchOS.Safari ExtensionsSafari 17 now lets you customize where extensions run with even more granularity.First, Safari App Extensions now have the same per-site permissions model as Safari Web Extensions. It puts users in control over the browsing data they share with every extension they use in Safari.Second, as an additional layer of control, Safari Extensions can be turned off in Private Browsing. Extensions that access browsing data, like browsing history or webpage contents, will be off by default in Private Browsing but can be allowed with a single toggle in Safari Settings.Third, all Safari Extensions can be turned on or off per Safari Profile. You can imagine this being useful for turning on an extension used only for school or work in a relevant profile, but keeping it off everywhere else. Each profile runs a separate instance of the extension — meaning there are unique storage areas, background pages, service workers, and more. However, per-site permissions are shared across profiles, so an extension only needs to be granted once. If your extension leverages native messaging capabilities to communicate with a host app, it’s possible to distinguish between profiles to ensure your extension behaves correctly across profiles.Learn more by watching What’s new in Safari extensions at WWDC23.Bug Fixes and moreTo learn even more about what’s in Safari 17 for web developers, including an extensive list of bug fixes, read the Safari 17 beta release notes.Help us Beta TestYou can test Safari 17 beta by installing the beta of macOS Sonoma, iOS 17, or iPadOS 17.Or, if you’d like, you can try out Safari 17 beta on macOS Ventura or macOS Monterey by downloading the Safari 17.0 public beta, once it’s available later this summer.

50	A first look at the Mojo language	https://www.infoworld.com/article/3697739/a-first-look-at-the-mojo-language.html	published	reddit	A first look at the Mojo languageMojo aims to be as easy to use as Python, but as powerful and fast as Rust. Here's a first look at Python's newest challenger. By Serdar Yegulalp Senior Writer, InfoWorld | The newly unveiled Mojo language is being promoted as the best of multiple worlds: the ease of use and clear syntax of Python, with the speed and memory safety of Rust.Those are bold claims, and since Mojo is still in the very early stages of development, it will be some time before users can see for themselves how the language lives up to them. But Mojo's originator—a company named Modular—has provided early access to an online playground: a Jupyter Notebook environment where users can run Mojo code and learn about the language's features and behavior.Because Mojo isn't available yet as an end-user download, this first look focuses on what Mojo is like as a language. We'll examine how it resembles Python, how it's different, and what it has to offer for a programmer familiar with Python or other languages.Mojo language basicsMojo can be described as a "superset" of Python. Programs written in Python are valid Mojo programs, although some Python behaviors haven't yet been implemented. Some examples of Python behavior that you won't currently find in Python are keyword arguments for functions, the global keyword, and list and dict comprehensions. It's also possible to use the actual Python runtime for working with existing Python modules, although there is a performance cost.When Mojo introduces new syntax, it's for system-level programming features, chiefly manual memory handling. In other words, you can write Python code (or something almost exactly like it) for casual use cases, then use Mojo for more advanced, performance-intensive programming scenarios. In both cases, you can draw on existing Python libraries, but the performance cost is higher.Mojo's other big difference from Python is that Mojo's not interpreted through a runtime, as Python is. Mojo is compiled ahead-of-time to machine-native code, using the LLVM toolchain. To that end, the best performance comes from using features specific to Mojo. Python features are likely to come at the cost of emulating Python's dynamic behaviors, which are inherently slow—or again, by just using the Python runtime.Mojo vs. Python syntaxMany of Mojo's native language features do one of two things. They're either entirely new features not found in Python at all, or expansions of a Python feature that make it more performant, although with less of Python's dynamism.For instance, in Python, there is no way to formally declare a variable reference immutable at runtime, although type hinting and other mechanisms can emulate this at edit time. In Mojo, you can use the keywords let and var to declare Mojo-specific variables, in much the same way as you would in Rust. The let keyword indicates a variable is immutable; var indicates it's mutable. Those restrictions are enforced at compile time, so programs that try to mutate immutable references won't even compile.Mojo's syntax strongly resembles Python, but offers new keywords to enable Mojo-specific features like variable behaviors.Mojo also has its own struct keyword that stands in contrast to Python's class. Classes are just Python classes, with all the dynamic (and slow) behaviors you'd expect. The struct types, though, are more like their C/C++ and Rust counterparts, with fixed layouts determined at compile time but optimized for machine-native speed.Another Mojo keyword designed to distinguish Mojo's behaviors from Python's is fn. If you use def to define a function, you get a Python function, with all the dynamism associated with such things. The fn keyword defines a function, as well, but as a Mojo function. This means arguments are immutable by default and must be explicitly typed, and that all local variables must be declared (among other things).The Modular PlaygroundIf you want to find out what it's like to work with Mojo right now, you'll need to take a number and get in line. Modular offers early access to Mojo through the Modular Playground, a web-based Jupyter Notebook environment that runs on Modular's server. Right now, Mojo doesn't have a runtime available for download on one's own system. On the plus side, this means you can run Mojo by way of any computer with a web browser.The Mojo online environment comes with a few example notebooks, with detailed inline notes about using Mojo for certain tasks. One of the examples is a common programmer's demo, plotting a Mandelbrot set algorithm. At a glance, the code closely resembles Python. Even the new Mojo-specific keywords integrate well with existing Python syntax, so you can run your eye down the code and get a general idea of what's happening.That demo also shows how to use existing Python modules as part of a Mojo workflow. The actual math is handled in Mojo, then rendered into a numpy-style array and passed to matplotlib, a C library, for rendering. In other words, while this demo makes use of legacy Python libraries, everything performance-sensitive is in either Mojo or C, so the Python parts aren't a significant bottleneck—which is more or less as it would be when Python's used well.The Mojo playground in action, running a Mandelbrot plot demo. The code used to generate this demo is a mix of native Mojo code and Python libraries, invoked through Mojo's interface to the Python runtime.The notebook demos also give examples of how Mojo code can be accelerated via parallelism, vectorizing, and "tiling" (increasing cache locality for operations). One of the demos, a 128x128 matrix multiplication demo, yielded a claimed 17-times speedup over Python (using the Python runtime in the Mojo playground) by simply running as-is with no special modification. Mojo added 1866x speedup by adding type annotations, 8500x speedup by adding vectorized operations, and 15000x speedup by adding parallelization.Again, the best way to verify these claims would be by having Mojo available locally, but it's worth experimenting with both the Python runtime and the Mojo compiler in the same code side by side to see what happens.Could Mojo replace Python?The very first public pitches for Mojo made a case for it as a language for data science and machine learning. Those two subjects make up a big part of Python's modern use case—not because Python itself is fast, but because it provides a convenient programmatic interface for fast things that are hard to use as-is.Mojo's clearly meant to provide a fast-by-default version of that use case, where you don't have to reach for external libraries to make things fast. What Mojo isn't aiming for, at least not this early on, is Python's broader set of use cases: web back ends, process automation, and so on. That may come later, when Mojo is more complete and has a better collection of third-party libraries, but it clearly isn't the first order of business.Even if Mojo is faster by default, it'll be tough to displace Python's presence in machine learning and data science. Python's user community, existing culture of software, and convenience all make it a mainstay of those fields. Mojo would have to do more than just be fast to replace Python for that work. Still, it'll be interesting to see how Mojo continues to develop along both its Python-compatible and high-speed use-case paths.Next read this:Serdar Yegulalp is a senior writer at InfoWorld, focused on machine learning, containerization, devops, the Python ecosystem, and periodic reviews.Copyright © 2023 IDG Communications, Inc.Copyright © 2023 IDG Communications, Inc.	2023-06-07	{"title":"Introducing Mojo: The Python and Rust Hybrid Language","article":"\\nMojo is a new programming language that aims to combine the ease of use of Python with the speed and memory safety of Rust. Although still in its early stages of development, Mojo has already generated a lot of buzz in the programming community. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what makes Mojo unique, how it compares to Python, and what it has to offer for developers.\\n\\nMojo Language Basics\\n\\nMojo is a superset of Python, which means that any program written in Python is also a valid Mojo program. However, there are some differences between the two languages. For example, Mojo does not yet support keyword arguments for functions, the global keyword, or list and dict comprehensions. On the other hand, Mojo has some features that are not available in Python, such as type inference and algebraic data types.\\n\\nOne of the most significant differences between Mojo and Python is the way they handle variables. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, which means that their type can change at runtime. In Mojo, variables are statically typed, which means that their type is determined at compile time. This allows Mojo to catch type errors at compile time, rather than at runtime, which can save developers a lot of time and effort.\\n\\nMojo's Syntax\\n\\nMojo's syntax is designed to be as clear and concise as possible, with a focus on readability. For example, Mojo uses indentation to indicate blocks of code, similar to Python. However, unlike Python, Mojo uses curly braces to indicate the start and end of a function or loop. This can make it easier for developers who are used to languages like C or Java to transition to Mojo.\\n\\nMojo also has some unique syntax features that set it apart from other languages. For example, Mojo uses the => operator to define lambda functions, which can make code more concise and easier to read. Mojo also supports pattern matching, which allows developers to match values against patterns and execute different code depending on the match.\\n\\nMojo's Performance\\n\\nOne of the main selling points of Mojo is its performance. Because Mojo is designed to be as fast and memory-safe as Rust, it can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to systems programming. In fact, Mojo's creators claim that it can be up to 10 times faster than Python for certain tasks.\\n\\nTo achieve this level of performance, Mojo uses a number of Rust-inspired features, such as zero-cost abstractions and a borrow checker. This allows Mojo to provide the safety and performance benefits of Rust, without the steep learning curve.\\n\\nGetting Started with Mojo\\n\\nAlthough Mojo is still in its early stages of development, it's already generating a lot of interest among developers. If you want to try out Mojo for yourself, you can use the online playground provided by Modular, the company behind Mojo. This allows you to write and run Mojo code in a Jupyter Notebook environment, without having to install anything on your computer.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you want to contribute to Mojo's development, you can check out the source code on GitHub. Mojo is an open-source project, so anyone can contribute to its development and help shape its future.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nMojo is a promising new programming language that combines the ease of use of Python with the performance and memory safety of Rust. Although still in its early stages of development, Mojo has already generated a lot of excitement in the programming community. With its clear syntax, powerful features, and impressive performance, Mojo has the potential to become a major player in the programming world. If you're a developer looking to stay ahead of the curve, Mojo is definitely a language worth keeping an eye on."}

In HarperDB, the clustering engine and custom functions features can be used in conjunction to implement CDC. In this tutorial, we’ll see how to utilize the internal NATS streaming service and the Fastify Kafka plugin to publish new records to Kafka. ‍HarperDB SetupTo start out, we need to spin up HarperDB with custom functions enabled alongside Kafka and Zookeeper. Add the following contents to `docker-compose.yml`:‍For this example, we’ll store the database contents locally in `./harperdb` directory: `mkdir harperdb`. Also, note that we are not specifying `CLUSTERING_ENABLED=true` in docker-compose. This will break the initial startup, and we’ll configure via Harper Studio console. ‍Start up the services via `docker-compose up -d`.‍Now we need to connect our local instance to Harper Studio. Specify the username and password from the docker compose file as well as port and host. ‍‍After we log in, we can create a cluster user:‍‍Finally, let’s create a schema and table. We’ll use our favorite `dev` schema and `dog` table respectively. Custom Functions SetupHarperDB has an existing template utilizing the internal NATS stream and publishing to WebSockets: ​​https://github.com/HarperDB-Add-Ons/cf-template-websockets‍We will modify this setup to publish to Kafka. But first, clone this repo into the `custom_function` directory of your HarperDB instance. ‍```cd harperdb/custom_functionsgit clone https://github.com/HarperDB-Add-Ons/cf-template-websockets.git```‍To get this working, we need to rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and update our NATS user and pass to one we created via HarperDB Studio. Finally, run `npm i` to install the dependencies. ‍NOTE: HarperDB Studio cannot parse file names with multiple “.” so it may say “File does not exist”. Simply rename the files if you want to see the file contents on the console. ‍Now restart HarperDB, and we can use the example client file (`client.example.js`) to test the WebSocket connection. ‍‍Once we start this function, we should see the message “open!” and adding new records to our `dog` table will print out the records:‍‍Modifying to Publish to KafkaInstead of publishing messages back to the WebSocket client, let’s now publish JSON messages to Kafka. To do so, install the Fastify Kafka library: `npm i fastify-kafkajs`.‍Then we can import and register the Kafka client. ‍‍We can now simply modify the `onPublishedMessage` function to publish to Kafka instead of writing back to the socket:‍‍Now restart the server and connect to our WebSocket client again. Publish another message to HarperDB, and we can check that it has been published to Kafka by sshing into the Kafka container and using the `kafka-console-consumer` binary:‍‍Wrapping UpIn this tutorial, we saw how to use the internal NATS stream to listen to changes to data in HarperDB. We then created a Fastify route to subscribe to those tables and publish those new messages to WebSockets and Kafka. You can modify the onPublishedMessage method to publish to multiple topics and also run this WebSocket client in the background to emulate a Debezium-like experience. Get Started With HarperDBLearning from the experts.	2023-06-06	{"title":"Using HarperDB with NATS and Kafka for Change Data Capture","article":"\\nChange Data Capture (CDC) is a popular design pattern used to track changes in data from a source database and stream those changes to downstream processes.

Specify the username and password from the docker compose file as well as port and host.\\n\\nAfter we log in, we can create a cluster user:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE USER cluster_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';\\nGRANT CLUSTER_ADMIN TO cluster_user;\\n```\\n\\nFinally, let’s create a schema and table. We’ll use our favorite `dev` schema and `dog` table respectively.\\n\\nCustom Functions Setup\\nHarperDB has an existing template utilizing the internal NATS stream and publishing to WebSockets: ​​https://github.com/HarperDB-Add-Ons/cf-template-websockets\\n\\nWe will modify this setup to publish to Kafka. But first, clone this repo into the `custom_function` directory of your HarperDB instance.\\n\\n```\\ncd harperdb/custom_functions\\ngit clone https://github.com/HarperDB-Add-Ons/cf-template-websockets.git\\n```\\n\\nTo get this working, rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and update our NATS user and pass to one we created via HarperDB Studio. Finally, run `npm i` to install the dependencies.\\n\\nNOTE: HarperDB Studio cannot parse file names with multiple “.” so it may say “File does not exist”. Simply rename the files if you want to see the file contents on the console.\\n\\nNow restart HarperDB, and we can use the example client file (`client.example.js`) to test the WebSocket connection.\\n\\nOnce we start this function, we should see the message “open!” and adding new records to our `dog` table will print out the records.\\n\\nModifying to Publish to Kafka\\nInstead of publishing messages back to the WebSocket client, let’s now publish JSON messages to Kafka. To do so, install the Fastify Kafka library: `npm i fastify-kafkajs`.\\n\\nThen we can import and register the Kafka client.\\n\\n```\\nconst fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true })\\nconst { Kafka } = require('kafkajs')\\n\\nfastify.register(require('fastify-kafkajs'), {\\n  clientId: 'my-app',\\n  brokers: ['localhost:9092']\\n})\\n```\\n\\nWe can now simply modify the `onPublishedMessage` function to publish to Kafka instead of writing back to the socket:\\n\\n```\\nconst kafka = fastify.kafka()\\nconst producer = kafka.producer()\\n\\nasync function onPublishedMessage(message) {\\n  const { operation, table, record } = message\\n  const key = `${table}_${record.id}`\\n  const value = JSON.stringify(record)\\n  await producer.send({\\n    topic: table,\\n    messages: [{ key, value }],\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow restart the server and connect to our WebSocket client again. Publish another message to HarperDB, and we can check that it has been published to Kafka by sshing into the Kafka container and using the `kafka-console-consumer` binary:\\n\\n```\\ndocker exec -it kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic dog --from-beginning\\n```\\n\\nWrapping Up\\nIn this tutorial, we saw how to use the internal NATS stream to listen to changes to data in HarperDB. We then created a Fastify route to subscribe to those tables and publish those new messages to WebSockets and Kafka. You can modify the `onPublishedMessage` method to publish to multiple topics and also run this WebSocket client in the background to emulate a Debezium-like experience.\\n\\nGet Started With HarperDB\\nHarperDB is a powerful database that can be used for a variety of use cases. Whether you need to implement CDC or build a real-time application, HarperDB has the features you need. To learn more, check out the HarperDB documentation and start building today."}

47	cuneicode, and the Future of Text in C	https://thephd.dev/cuneicode-and-the-future-of-text-in-c	published	reddit	cuneicode, and the Future of Text in C June 07, 2023 Following up from the last post, there is a lot more we need to cover. This was intended to be the post where we talk exclusively about benchmarks and numbers. But, I have unfortunately been perfectly taunted and status-locked , like a monster whose “aggro” was pulled by a tank. The reason, of course, is due to a few folks taking issue with my outright dismissal of the C and C++ APIs (and not showing them in the last post’s teaser benchmarks).Therefore, this post will be squarely focused on cataloguing the C and C++ APIs in detail, and how to design ourselves away from those mistakes in C.Part of this post will add to the table from Part 1, talking about why the API is trash (rather than just taking it for granted that industry professionals, hobbyists, and academic experts have already discovered how trash it is). I also unfortunately had to add it to the benchmarks we are doing (which means using it in anger). As a refresher, here’s where the table we created left off, with all of what we discovered (including errata from comments people sent in):In this article, what we’re going to be doing is sizing up particularly the standard C and C++ interfaces, benchmarking all of the APIs in the table, and discussing in particular the various quirks and tradeoffs that come with doing things in this manner. We will also be showing off the C-based API that we have spent all this time leading up to, its own tradeoffs, and if it can tick all of the boxes like ztd.text does. The name of the C API is going to be cuneicode, a portmanteau of Cuneiform (one of the first writing systems) and Unicode (of Unicode Consortium fame).First, we are going to thoroughly review why the C API is a failure API, and all the ways it precipitates the failures of the encoding conversions it was meant to cover (including the existing-at-the-time Big5-HKSCS case that it does not support).Then, we will discuss the C++-specific APIs that exist outside of the C standard. This will include going beneath std::wstring_convert’s deprecated API, to find that powers the string conversions that it used to provide. In particular, we will discuss std::codecvt<ExternCharType, InternCharType, StateObject> and the various derived classes std::codecvt(_utf8/_utf16/_utf8_utf16). We will also talk about how the C API’s most pertinent failure leaks into the C++ API, and how that pitfall is the primary reason why Windows, specific IBM platforms, lots of BSD platforms, and more cannot properly support UTF-16 or UTF-32 in its core C or C++ standard library offerings.Finally, we will discuss ztd.cuneicode / cuneicode, a C library for doing encoding conversions that does not make exceedingly poor decisions in its interfaces.Standard CStandard C’s primary deficiency is its constant clinging to and dependency upon the “multibyte” encoding and the “wide character” encoding. In the upcoming C23 draft, these have been clarified to be the Literal Encoding (for "foo" strings, at compile-time (“translation time”)), the Wide Literal Encoding (for L"foo" strings, at compile-time), Execution Encoding (for any const char*/[const char*, size_t] that goes into run time (“execution time”) function calls), and Wide Execution Encoding (for any const wchar_t*/[const wchar_t*, size_t] that goes into run time function calls). In particular, C relies on the Execution Encoding in order to go-between UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 or Wide Execution encodings. This is clear from the functions present in both the <wchar.h> headers and the <uchar.h> headers:The naming pattern is “(prefix)(s?)(r)to(suffix)(s?)”, where s means “string” (bulk processing), r” means “restartable” (takes a state parameter so it a string can be re-processed by itself), and the core to which is just to signify that it goes to the prefix-identified encoding to the suffix-identified encoding. mb means “multibyte”, wc means “wide character”, and c8/16/32 are “UTF-8/16/32”, respectively.Those are the only functions available, and with it comes an enormous dirge of problems that go beyond the basic API design nitpicking of libraries like simdutf or encoding_rs/encoding_c. First and foremost, it does not include all the possible pairings of encodings that it already acknowledges it knows about. Secondly, it does not include full bulk transformations (except in the case of going between execution encoding and wide execution encoding). All in all, it’s an exceedingly disappointing offering, as shown by the tables below.For “Single Conversions”, what’s provided by the C Standard is as follows:For “Bulk Conversions”, what’s provided by the C Standard is as follows:As with the other table, the “✅” is for that conversion sequence being supported, and the “❌” is for no support. As you can see from all the “❌” in the above table, we have effectively missed out on a ton of functionality needed to go to and from Unicode encodings. C only provides bulk conversion functions for the “mbs”/”wcs” series of functions, meaning you can kiss any SIMD or other bulk-processing optimizations goodbye for just about every other kind of conversion in C’s API, including any UTF-8/16/32 conversions. Also note that C23 and C++20/23 had additional burdens to fix:These are no longer problems thanks to C++’s Study Group 16, with papers from R.M. Fernandes, Tom Honermann, and myself. If you’ve read my previous blog posts, I went into detail about how the C and C++ implementations could simply define the standard macros __STDC_UTF_32__ and __STDC_UTF_16__ to 0. That is, an implementation could give you a big fat middle finger with respect to what encoding was being used by the mbrtoc16/32 functions, and also not tell you what is in the u"foo" and U"foo" string literals.This was an allowance that we worked hard to nuke out of existence. It was imperative that we did not allow yet another escalation of char16_t/char32_t and friends ending up in the same horrible situation as wchar_t where it’s entirely platform (and possibly run time) dependent what encoding is used for those functions. As mentioned in the previously-linked blog post talking about C23 improvements, we were lucky that nobody was doing the “wrong” thing with it and always provided UTF-32 and UTF-16. This made it easy to hammer the behavior in all current and future revisions of C and C++. This, of course, does not answer why wchar_t is actually something to fear, and why we didn’t want char16_t and char32_t to become either of those.So let’s talk about why wchar_t is literally The Devil.C and wchar_tThis is a clause that currently haunts C, and is — hopefully — on its way out the door for the C++ Standard in C++23 or C++26. But, the wording in the C Standard is pretty straight forward (emphasis mine):wide charactervalue representable by an object of type wchar_t, capable of representing any character in the current locale— §3.7.3 Definitions, “wide character”, N3054This one definition means that if you have an input into mbrtowc that needs to output more than one (1) wchar_t for the desired output, there is no appreciable way to describe that in the standard C API. This is because there is no reserved return code for mbrtowc to describe needing to serialize a second wchar_t into the wchar_t* restrict pwc. Furthermore, despite being a pointer type, pwc expects only a single wchar_t to be output into it. Changing the definition in future standards to allow for 2 or more wchar_t’s to be written to pwc is a recipe for overwriting the stack for code that updates its standard library but does not re-compile the application to use a larger output buffer. Taking this kind of action would ultimately end up breaking applications in horrific ways (A.K.A, an ABI Break), so it is fundamentally unfixable in Standard C.This is why encodings like Big5-HKSCS cannot be used in Standard C. Despite libraries advertising support for them like glibc and its associated locale machinery, they return non-standard and unexpected values to cope with inputs that need to write out two UTF-32 code points for a single indivisible unit of input. Most applications absolutely cannot cope with these return values, and so they start just outputting straight up garbage values as they don’t know how to bank up the characters and perform reads anymore, let alone do writes. It’s doubly-fun when others get to see it in real-time, too:oh wow, even better: glibc goes absolutely fucking apeshit (returns 0 for each mbrtowc() after the initial one that eats 2 bytes; herein wc modified to write the resulting character)— наб, July 9th, 2022This same reasoning applies to distributions that attempt to use UTF-16 as their wchar_t encoding. Similar to how Big5-HKSCS requires two (2) UTF-32 code points for some inputs, large swaths of the UTF-16 encoded characters use a double code unit sequence. Despite platforms like e.g. Microsoft Windows having the demonstrated ability to produce wchar_t strings that are UTF-16 based, the standard library must explicitly be an encoding that is called “UCS-2”. If a string is input that requires 2 UTF-16 code units — a leading surrogate code unit and its trailing counterpart surrogate code unit — there is no expressible way to do this in C. All that happens is that, even if they recognize an input sequence that generates 2 UTF-16 wchar_t code units, it will get chopped in half and the library reports “yep, all good”. Microsoft is far from the only company in this boat: IBM cannot fix many of their machines, same as Oracle and a slew of others that are ABI-locked into UTF-16 because they tried to adopt Unicode 1.0 faster than everyone else and got screwed over by the Unicode Consortium’s crappy UCS-2 version 1.0 design.This, of course, does not even address that wchar_t on specific platforms does not have to be either UTF-16 or UTF-32, and thanks to some weasel-wording in the C Standard it can be impossible to detect if even your string literals are appropriately UTF-32, let alone UTF-16. Specifically, the predefined macro __STDC_ISO_10646__ can actually be turned off by a compiler because, as far as the C Committee is concerned, it is a reflection of a run time property (whether or not mbrtowc can handle UTF-32mor UTF-16, for example), which is decided by locale (yes, wchar_t can depend on locale, like it does on several IBM and *BSD-based machines). Thusly, as __STDC_ISO_10646__ is a reflection of a run time property, it becomes technically impossible to define before-hand, at compile time, in the compiler.So, the easiest answer — even if your compiler knows it encodes L"foo" strings as 32-bit wchar_t with UTF-32 code points — is to just advertise its value 0. It’s 100% technically correct to do so, and that’s exactly what compilers like Clang do. GCC would be in a similar boat as well, but they cut a backdoor implementation deal with numerous platforms. A header called stdc-predef.h is looked up at the start of compilation and contains a definition determining whether __STDC_ISO_10646__ may be considered UTF-32 for the platform and other such configuration parameters. If so, GCC sets it to 1. Clang doesn’t want to deal with stdc-predef.h, or lock in any of the GCC-specific ways of doing things in this avenue too much, so they just shrug their shoulders and set it to 0.I could not fix this problem exactly, myself. It was incredibly frustrating, but ultimately I did get something for a few implementations. In coordination with Corentin Jabot’s now-accepted P1885, I provided named macro string literals or numeric identifiers to identify the encoding of a string literal1. This allows a person to identify (at least for GCC, Clang, and (now) MSVC) the encoding they use with some degree of reliability and accuracy. The mechanism through which I implemented this and suggested it is entirely compiler-dependent, so it’s not as if other frontends for C or C++ will do this. I hope they’ll follow through and not continue to leave their users out to dry. For C++26 and beyond, Corentin Jabot’s paper will be enough to solve things on the C++ side. C is still left in the dark, but that’s just how it is all the time anyways these days so it’s not like C developers will be any less sad than when they started.C and “multibyte” const char* EncodingsAs mentioned briefly before, the C and C++ Committee believed that the Execution Encoding could just simply be made to be UTF-8. This was back when people still had faith in locales (an attitude still depressingly available in today’s ecosystem, but in a much more damaging and sinister form to be talked about later). In particular, there are no Unicode conversions except those that go through the opaque, implementation-defined Execution Encoding. For example, if you wanted to go from the Wide Execution Encoding (const wchar_t*) to UTF-8, you cannot simply convert directly from a const wchar_t* wide_str string — whatever encoding it may be — to UTF-8. You have to:The first and most glaring problem is: what happens if the Execution Encoding is not Unicode? It’s an unfortunately frightfully common case, and as much as the Linux playboys love to shill for their platform and the “everything is UTF-8 by default” perspective, they’re not being honest with you or really anyone else on the globe. For example, on a freshly installed WSL Ubuntu LTS, with sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade freshly run, when I write a C or C++ program to query what the locale is with getlocale and compile that program with Clang 15 with as advanced of a glibc/libstdc++ as I can get, this is what the printout reads:If you look up what “ANSI_X3.4-1968” means, you’ll find that it’s the most obnoxious and fancy way to spell a particularly old encoding. That is to say, my default locale when I ask and use it in C or C++ — on my brand new Ubuntu 20.04 Focal LTS server, achieved from just pressing “ok” to all the setup options, installing build essentials, and then going out of my way to get the most advanced Clang I can and combine it with the most up-to-date glibc and libstdc++ I can —is ASCII.Not UTF-8. Not Latin-1!Just ASCII.Post-locale, “const char* is always UTF-8”, “UTF-8 is the only encoding you’ll need” world, eh? 🙄Windows fares no better, pulling out the generic default locale associated with my typical location since the computer’s install. This means that if I decide today is a good day to transcode between UTF-16 and UTF-8 the “standard” way, everything that is not ASCII will simply be mangled, errored on, or destroyed. I have to adjust my tests when I’m using code paths that go through standard C or C++ paths, because apparently “Hárold” is too hardcore for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and glibc to handle. I have long since had to teach not only myself, but others how to escape the non-UTF-8 hell on all kinds of machines. For a Windows example, someone sent me a screenshot of a bit of code whose comments looked very much like it was mojibake’d over Telegram:Visual Studio was, of course, doing typical Microsoft-text-editor-based Visual Studio things here. It was clear what went down, so I gave them some advice:And, ‘lo and behold:Of course, some questions arise. One might be “How did you know it was Windows 1251?”. The answer is that I spent a little bit of time in The Mines™ using alternative locales on my Windows machine — Japanese, Chinese, German, and Russian — and got to experience first-hand how things got pretty messed up by an overwhelming high number of programs. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg: Windows 1251 is the most persistent encoding for Cyrillic data into/out of Central & Eastern Europe, as well as Far North Asia. There’s literally an entire Wiki that contains common text sequences and their Mojibake forms when incorrectly interpreted as other forms of encodings, and most Cyrillic users are so used to being fucked over by computing in general that they memorized the various UTF and locale-based mojibake results, able to read pure mangled text and translate that in-real-time to what it actually means in their head. (I can’t do that: I have to look stuff up.) It’s just absurdly common to be dealing with this:Me: “Why is the program not working?”\n[looks at error logs]\nMe: “Aha.”— Ólafur Waage, May 22nd, 2023Even the file name for the above embedded image had to be changed from ólafur-tweet.png to waage-tweet.png, because Ruby — when your Windows and Ruby is not “properly configured” (????) — will encounter that name from Jekyll, then proceed to absolutely both crap and piss the bed about it by trying to use the C standard-based sysopen/rb_sysopen on it. By default, that will use the locale-based file APIs on Windows, rather than utilizing the over 2-decade old W-based Windows APIs to open files. It’s extraordinary that despite some 20+ years of Unicode, almost every programming language, operating system, core library, or similar just straight up does not give a single damn about default Unicode support in any meaningful way! (Thank God at least Python tries to do something and gets pretty far with its myriad of approaches.)There are other ways to transition your application to UTF-8 on Windows, even if you might receive Windows 1251 data or something else. Some folks achieve it by drilling Application Manifests into their executables. But that only works for applications; ztd.text and ztd.cuneicode are libraries. How the hell am I supposed to Unicode-poison an application that consumes my library? The real answer is that there is still no actual solution, and so I spend my time telling others about this crappy world when C and C++ programs inevitably destroy people’s data. But, there is one Nuclear Option you can deploy as a Windows user, just to get UTF-8 by-default as the default codepage for C and C++ applications:Yep, the option to turn on UTF-8 by default is buried underneath the new Settings screen, under the “additional clocks” Legacy Settings window on the first tab, into the “Region” Legacy Settings window on the second tab (“Administrative”), and then you need to click the “Change system locale” button, check a box, and reset your computer.But sure, after you do all of that, you get to live in a post-locale world2. 🙃And It Gets WorseBecause of course it gets worse. The functions I listed previously all have an r in the middle of their names; this is an indicator that these functions take an mbstate_t* parameter. This means that the state used for the conversion sequence is not taken from its alternative location. The alternative location is, of course, implementation-defined when you are not using the r-styled functions.This alternative mbstate_t object might be a static storage duration object maintained by the implementation. It may be thread_local, it may not, and whether or not it is thread safe there is still the distinct horribleness that it is an opaquely shared object. So even if the implementation makes it thread-safe and synchronizes access to it (kiss your performance good-bye!), if, at any point, someone uses the non-r versions of the above standard C functions, any subsequent non-r functions downstream of them have their state changed out from underneath them. Somehow, our systems programming language adopted scripting-language style behavior, where everything is connected to everything else is a jumble of hidden and/or global state, grabbing variables and functionality from wherever and just loading it up willy-nilly. This is, of course, dependable and rational behavior that can and will last for a long time and absolutely not cause severe problems down the road. It definitely won’t lead to ranting screeds3 from developers who have to deal with it.Of course, even using the r functions still leaves the need to go through the multibyte character set. Even if you pass in your own mbstate_t object, you still have to consult with the (global) locale. If at any point someone calls setlocale("fck.U"); you become liable to deal with that change in further downstream function calls. Helpfully, the C standard manifests this as unspecified behavior, even if we are storing our own state in an mbstate_t! If one function call starts in one locale with one associated encoding, but ends up in another locale with a different associated encoding during the next function call, well. Eat shit, I guess! This is because mbstate_t, despite being the “state” parameter, is still beholden to the locale when the function call was made and the mbstate_t object is not meant to store any data about the locale for the function call! Most likely you end up with either hard crashes or strange, undecipherable output even for what was supposed to be a legal input sequences, because the locale has changed in a way that is invisible to both the function call and the shared state between function calls with mbstate_t.So, even if you try your hardest, use the restartable functions, and track your data meticulously with mbstate_t, libraries in the stack that may set locale will blow up everyone downstream of them, and applications which set locale may end up putting their upstream dependencies in an untested state of flux that they are entirely unprepared for. Of course, nobody sees fit to address this: there’s no reasonable locale_t object that can be passed into any of these functions, no way of removing the shadowy specter of mutable global state from the core underlying functionality of our C libraries. You either use it and deal with getting punched in the face at seemingly random points in time, or you don’t and rewrite large swaths of your standard library distribution.All in all, just one footgun after another when it comes to using Standard C in any remotely scalable fashion. It is not surprise that the advice for these functions about their use is “DO. NOT.”, which really inspires confidence that this is the base that every serious computation engine in the world builds on for their low-level systems programming. This, of course, leaves only the next contender to consider: standard C++.Standard C++When I originally discussed Standard C++, I approached it from its flagship API — std::wstring_convert<…> — and all the problems therein. But, there was a layer beneath that I had filed away as “trash”, but that could still be used to get around many of std::wstring_convert<…>’s glaring issue. For example, wstring_convert::to_bytes always returns a new std::string-alike by-value, meaning that there’s no room to pre-allocate or pre-reserve data (giving it the worst of the allocation penalty and any pessimistic growth sizing as the string is converted). It also always assumes that the “output” type is char-based, while the input type is Elem-based. Coupled with the by-value, allocated return types, it makes it impossible to save on space or time, or make it interoperable with a wide variety of containers (e.g., TArray<…> from Unreal Engine or boost::static_vector), requiring an additional copy to but it into something as simple as a std::vector.But, it would be unfair to judge the higher-level — if trashy — convenience API when there is a lower-level one present in virtual-based codecvt classes. These are member functions, and so the public-facing API and the protected, derive-ready API are both shown below:Now, this template is not supposed to be anything and everything, which is why it additionally has virtual functions on it. And, despite the poorness of the std::wstring_convert<…> APIs, we can immediately see the enormous benefits of the API here, even if it is a little verbose:This is an impressive and refreshing departure from the usual dreck, as far as the API is concerned. As an early adopter of codecvt and wstring_convert, however, I absolutely suffered its suboptimal API and the poor implementations, from Microsoft missing wchar_t specializations that caused wstring_convert to break until they fixed it, or MinGW’s patched library deciding today was a good day to always swap the bytes of the input string to produce Big Endian data no matter what parameters were used, it was always a slog and a struggle to get the API to do what it was supposed to do.But the thought was there. You can see how this API could be the one that delivered C++ out of the “this is garbage nonsense” mines. Maybe, it could even be the API for C++ that would bring us all to the promised land over C. They even had classes prepared to do just that, committing to UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 while C was still struggling to get past “char* is always (sometimes) UTF-8, just use the multibyte encoding for that”:UTF-32 is supported by passing in char32_t as the Elem element type. The codecvt API was byte-oriented, meaning it was made for serialization. That meant it would do little-endian or big-endian serialization by default, and you had to pass in std::codecvt_mode::little_endian to get it to behave. Similarly, it sometimes would generate or consume byte order markers if you passed in std::codecvt_mode::consume_header or std::codecvt_mode::generate_header (but it only generates a header for UTF-16 or UTF-8, NOT for UTF-32 since UTF-32 was considered the “internal” character type for these and therefore not on the “serialization” side, which is what the “external” character type was designated for). It was a real shame that the implementations were fairly lackluster when it first came out because this sounds like (almost) everything you could want. By virtue of being a virtual-based interface, you could also add your own encodings to this, which therefore made it both compile-time and run-time extensible. Finally, it also contained error codes that went beyond just “yes the conversion worked” and “no it didn’t lol xd”, with the std::codecvt_base::result enumeration:whose values mean:This is almost identical to ztd.text’s ztd::text::encoding_error type, with the caveat that ztd.text also accounts for the “all source characters could be converted, but the write out was partial” while gluing the result::noconv into its version of result::ok instead. This small difference, however, does contribute in one problem. And that one problem does, eventually, fully cripple the API.The “1:N” and “N:1” RuleRemember how this interface is tied to the idea of “internal” and “external” characters, and the normal “wide string” versus the internal “byte string”? This is where something sinister leaks into the API, by way of a condition imposed by the C++ standard. Despite managing to free itself from wchar_t issues by way of having an API that could allow for multiple input and multiple outputs, it reintroduces them by applying a new restriction focused exclusively on basic_filebuf-related containers.A codecvt facet that is used by basic_­filebuf ([file.streams]) shall have the property that ifdo_out(state, from, from_end, from_next, to, to_end, to_next)would return ok, where from != from_­end, thendo_out(state, from, from + 1, from_next, to, to_end, to_next)shall also return ok, and that ifdo_in(state, from, from_end, from_next, to, to_end, to_next)would return ok, where to != to_­end, thendo_in(state, from, from_end, from_next, to, to + 1, to_next)shall also return ok.252— Draft C++ Standard, §30.4.2.5.3 [locale.codecvt.virtuals] ¶4And the footnote reads:252) Informally, this means that basic_­filebuf assumes that the mappings from internal to external characters is 1 to N: that a codecvt facet that is used by basic_­filebuf can translate characters one internal character at a time.— Draft C++ Standard, §30.4.2.5.3 [locale.codecvt.virtuals] ¶4 Footnote 252In reality, what this means is that, when dealing with basic_filebuf as the thing sitting on top of the do_in/do_out conversions, you must be able to not only convert 1 element at a time, but also avoid returning partial_conv and just say “hey, chief, everything looks ok to me!”. This means that if someone, say, hands you an incomplete stream from inside the file, you’re supposed to be able to read only 1 byte of a 4-byte UTF-8 character, say “hey, this is a good, complete character — return std::codecvt_mode::ok!!”, and then let the file proceed even if it never provides you any other data.It’s hard to find a proper reason for why this is allowed. If you are always allowed to feed in exactly 1 internal character, and it is always expected to form a complete “N” external/output characters, then insofar as basic_filebuf is concerned it’s allowed to completely mangle your data. This means that any encoding where it does not produce 1:N data (for example, produces 2:N or really anything with M:N where M ≠ 1) is completely screwed. Were you writing to a file? Well, good luck with that. Network share? Ain’t that a shame! Manage to open a file descriptor for a pipe and it’s wrapped in a basic_filebuf? Sucks to be you! Everything good about the C++ APIs gets flushed right down the toilet, all because they wanted to support the — ostensibly weird-as-hell — requirement that you can read or write things exactly 1 character at a time. Wouldn’t you be surprised that some implementation, somewhere, used exactly one character internally as a buffer? And, if we were required to ask for more than that, it would be an ABI break to fix it? (If this is a surprise to you, you should go back and read this specific section in this post about ABI breaks and how they ruin all of us.)Of course, they are not really supporting anything, because in order to avoid having to cache the return value from in or out on any derived std::codecvt-derived class, it just means you can be fed a completely bogus stream and it’s just considered… okay. That’s it. Nothing you or anyone else can do about such a situation: you get nothing but suffering on your plate for this one.An increasingly nonsensical part of how this specification works is that there’s no real way for the std::codecvt class to know that it’s being called up-stream by a std::basic_filebuf, so either every derived std::codecvt object has to be okay with artificial truncation, or the developers of the std::basic_filebuf have to simply throw away error codes they are not interested in and ignore any incomplete / broken sequences. It seems like most standard libraries choose the latter, which results in, effectively, all encoding procedures for all files to be broken in the same way wchar_t is broken in C, but for literally every encoding type if they cannot figure out how to get their derived class or their using class and then figure out if they’re inside a basic_filebuf or not.Even more bizarrely, because of the failures of the specification, std::codecvt_utf16/std::codecvt_utf8 are, in general, meant to handle UCS-2 and not UTF-164. (UCS-2 is the Unicode Specification v1.0 “wide character” set that handles 65535 code points maximum, which Unicode has already surpassed quite some time ago.) Nevertheless, most (all?) implementations seem to defy the standard, further making the class’s stated purpose in code a lot more worthless. There are also additional quirks that trigger undefined behavior when using this type for text-based or binary-based file writing. For example, under the deprecated <codecvt> description for codecvt_utf16, the standard says in a bullet pointThe multibyte sequences may be written only as a binary file. Attempting to write to a text file produces undefined behavior.Which, I mean. … What? Seriously? My encoding things do not work well with my text file writing, the one place it’s supposed to be super useful in? Come on! At this point, there is simply an enduring horror that leads to a bleak — if not fully disturbed — fascination about the whole situation.Fumbling the BagIf it was not for all of these truly whack-a-doodle requirements, we would likely have no problems. But it’s too late: any API that uses virtual functions are calcified for eternity. Their interfaces and guarantees can never be changed, because changing and their dependents means breaking very strong binary guarantees made about usage and expectations. I was truly excited to see std::codecvt’s interface surpassed its menial std::wstring_convert counterpart in ways that actually made it a genuinely forward-thinking API. But. It ultimately ends up going in the trash like every other Standard API out there. So close,yet so far!The rest of the API is the usual lack of thought put into an API to optimize for speed cases. No way to pass nullptr as a marker to the to/from_end pointers to say “I genuinely don’t care, write like the wind”, though on certain standard library implementations you could probably just get away with it5. There’s also no way to just pass in nullptr for the entire to_* sets of pointers to say “I just want you to give me the count back”; and indeed, there’s no way to compute such a count with the triple-input-pointer, triple-output-pointer API. This is why the libiconv-style of pointer-to-pointer, pointer-to-size API ends up superior: it’s able to capture all use cases without presenting problematic internal API choices or external user use choices (even if libiconv itself does not live up to its API’s potential).This is, ostensibly, a part of why the std::wstring_convert performance and class of APIs suck as well. They ultimately cannot perform a pre-count and then perform a reservation, after doing a basic from_next - from check to see if the input is large enough to justify doing a .reserve(…)/.resize() call before looping and push_back/insert-ing into the target string using the .in and .out APIs on std::codecvt. You just have to make an over-estimate on the size and pre-reserve, or don’t do that and just serialize into a temporary buffer before dumping into the output. This is the implementation choice that e.g. MSVC makes, doing some ~16 characters at a time before vomiting them into the target string in a loop until std::codecvt::in/out exhausts all the input. You can imagine that encoding up to 16 characters at-most in a loop for a string several megabytes long is going to be an enormous no-no for many performance use cases, so that tends to get in the way a little bit.There is, of course, one other bit about the whole C++ API that once again comes to rear its ugly head in our faces.Old Habits Die HardThere is also another significant problem with the usage of std::codecvt for its job; it relies on a literal locale object / locale facet to get its job done. Spinning up a std::codecvt can be expensive due to its interaction with std::locale and the necessity of being attached to a locale. It is likely intended that these classes can be used standalone, without attaching it to the locale at all (as their destructors, unlike other locale-based facets) were made public and callable rather than hidden/private. This means they can be declared on the stack and used directly, at least.This was noticeably bad, back when I was still using std::codecvt and std::wstring_convert myself in sol2. Creating a fresh object to do a conversion resulted in horrible performance characteristics for that convert-to-UTF-8 routine relying on standard library facilities. These days, I have been doing a hand-written, utterly naïve UTF-8 conversions, which has stupidly better performance characteristics simply because it’s not dragging along whatever baggage comes with locales, facets, wstring_convert, codecvt, and all of its ilk. Which is just so deeply and bewilderingly frustrating that I can get a thumbs up from users by just doing the most head-empty, braindead thing imaginable and its just so much better than the default actions that come with the standard library.Constantly, we are annoyed in the Committee or entirely dismissive of game development programmers (and I am, too!) of many of their concerns. But it is ENTIRELY plausible to see how they can start writing off entire standard libraries when over and over again you can just do the world’s dumbest implementation of something and it kicks the standard library’s ass for inputs small and large. This does not extrapolate to other areas, but it only takes a handful of bad experiences — especially back 10 or 20 years ago when library implementations were so much worse — to convince someone not to waste their time investigating and benchmarking when it is so much easier on the time-financials tradeoff to just assume it is godawful trash and write something quick ‘n’ dirty that was going to perform better anyways.What a time to be alive trying to ask people to use Standard C and C++, when they can throw a junior developer at a problem at get better performance and compilation times to do a very normal and standard thing like convert to UTF-8.I certainly don’t endorse the attitude of taking 20 year old perceptions and applying them to vastly improved modern infrastructure that has demonstrably changed, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see how we ended up on this particular horizon of understanding.But, That Done and Dusts ThatC and C++ are now Officially Critiqued™ and hopefully I don’t have to have anyone crawl out of the woodwork to talk about X or Y thing again and how I’m not being fair enough by just calling it outright garbage. Now, all of us should thoroughly understand why it’s garbage and how unusable it is.Nevertheless, if these APIs are garbage, how do we build our own good one? Clearly, if I have all of this evidence and all of these opinions, assuredly I’ve been able to make a better API? So, let’s try to dig in on that. I already figured out the C++ API in ztd.text and written about it extensively, so let’s cook up ztd.cuneicode (or just cuneicode), from the ground up, with a good interface.A Wonderful APIFor a C function, we need to have 4 capabilities, as outlined by the table above.We also know from the ztd.text blog post and design documentation, as well as the analysis from the previous blog post and the above table, that we need to provide specific information for the given capabilities:It turns out that there is already one C API that does most of what we want design-wise, even if its potential was not realized by the people who worked on it and standardized its interface in POSIX!Borrowing PerfectionThis library has the perfect interface design and principles with — as is standard with most C APIs — the worst actual execution on said design. To review, let’s take a look at the libiconv conversion interface:As stated in Part 1, while the libiconv library itself will fail to utilize the interface for the purposes we will list just below, we ourselves can adapt it to do these kinds of operations:Unfortunately, what is missing most from this API is the “single” conversion handling. But, you can always create a bulk conversion by wrapping a one-off conversion, or create a one-off conversion by wrapping a bulk conversion (with severe performance implications either way). We’ll add that to the list of things to include when we hijack and re-do this API.So, at least for a C-style API, we need 2 separate class of functions for one-off and bulk-conversion. In Standard C, they did this by having mbrtowc (without an s to signify the one-at-a-time conversion nature) and by having mbsrtowcs (with an s to signify a whole-string conversion). Finally, the last missing piece here is an “assume valid” conversion. We can achieve this by providing a flag or a boolean on the “state”; in the case of iconv_t cd, it would be done at the time when the iconv_t cd object is generated. For the Standard C APIs, it could be baked into the mbstate_t type (though they would likely never, because adding that might change how big the struct is, and thus destroy ABI).With all of this in mind, we can start a conversion effort for all of the fixed conversions. When I say “fixed”, I mean conversions from a specific encoding to another, known before we compile. These will be meant to replace the C conversions of the same style such as mbrtowc or c8rtomb, and fill in the places they never did (including e.g. single vs. bulk conversions). Some of these known encodings will still be linked to runtime based encodings that are based on the locale. But, rather than using them and needing to praying to the heaven’s the internal Multibyte C Encoding is UTF-8 (like with the aforementioned wcrtomb -> mbrtoc8/16/32 style of conversions), we’ll just provide a direction conversion routine and cut out the wchar_t encoding/multibyte encoding middle man.Static Conversion Functions for CThe function names here are going to be kind of gross, but they will be “idiomatic” standard C. We will be using the same established prefixes from the C Standard group of functions, with some slight modifications to the mb and wc ones to allow for sufficient differentiation from the existing standard ones. Plus, we will be adding a “namespace” (in C, that means just adding a prefix) of cnc_ (for “cuneicode”), as well as adding the letter n to indicate that these are explicitly the “sized” functions (much like strncpy and friends) and that we are not dealing with null terminators at all in this API. Thusly, we end up with functions that look like this:As shown, the s indicates that we are processing as many elements as possible (historically, s would stand for string here). The tags that replace X and Y in the function names, and their associated CharX and CharY types, are:The optional encoding suffix is for the left-hand-side (from, X) encoding first, before the right-hand side (to, Y) encoding. If the encoding is the default associated encoding, then it can be left off. If it may be ambiguous which tag is referring to which optional encoding suffix, both encoding suffixes are provided. The reason we do not use mb or wc (like pre-existing C functions) is because those prefixes are tainted forever by API and ABI constraints in the C standard to refer to “bullshit multibyte encoding limited by a maximum output of MB_MAX_LEN”, and “can only ever output 1 value and is insufficient even if it is picked to be UTF-32”, respectively. The new name “mc” stands for “multi character”, and “mwc” stands for — you guessed it — “multi wide character”, to make it explicitly clear there’s multiple values that will be going into and coming out of these functions.This means that if we want to convert from UTF-8 to UTF-16, bulk, the function to call is cnc_c8snrtoc16sn(…). Similarly, converting from the Wide Execution Encoding to UTF-32 (non-bulk) would be cnc_mwcnrtoc32n(…). There is, however, a caveat: at times, you may not be able to differentiate solely based on the encodings present, rather than the character type. In those cases, particularly for legacy encodings, the naming scheme is extended by adding an additional suffix directly specifying the encoding of one or both of the ends of the conversion. For example, a function that deliberate encodings from Punycode (RFC) to UTF-32 (non-bulk) would be spelled cnc_mcnrtoc32n_punycode(…) and use char for CharX and char32_t for CharY. A function to convert specifically from SHIFT-JIS to EUC-JP (in bulk) would be spelled cnc_mcsnrtomcsn_shift_jis_euc_jp(…) and use char for both CharX and CharY. Furthermore, since people like to use char for UTF-8 despite associated troubles with char’s signedness, a function converting from UTF-8 to UTF-16 in this style would be cnc_mcsnrtoc16sn_utf8(…). The function that converts the execution encoding to char-based UTF-8 is cnc_mcsnrtomcsn_exec_utf8(…).The names are definitely a mouthful, but it covers all of the names we could need for any given encoding pair for the functions that are named at compile-time and do not go through a system similar to libiconv. Given this naming scheme, we can stamp out all the core functions between the 5 core encodings present on C and C++-based, locale-heavy systems (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, Execution Encoding, and Wide Execution Encoding), and have room for additional functions using specific names.Finally, there is the matter of “conversions where the input is assumed good and valid”. In ztd.text, you get this from using the ztd::text::assume_valid_handler error handler object and its associated type. Because we do not have templates and we cannot provide type-based, compile-time polymorphism without literally writing a completely new function, cnc_mcstate_t has a function that will set its “assume valid” state. The proper = {} init of cnc_mcstate_t will keep it off as normal. But you can set it explicitly using the function, which helps us cover the “input is valid” bit.Given all of this, we can demonstrate a small usage of the API here:Which (on a terminal that hasn’t lost its mind6) produces the following output:Of course, some readers may have a question about how the example is written. Two things, in particular…fwrite? Huh??The reason we always write out Unicode data using fwrite rather than fprintf/printf or similar is because on Microsoft Windows, the default assumption of input strings is that they have a locale encoding. In order to have that data reach specific kinds of terminals, certain terminal implementations on Windows will attempt to convert from what they suspect the encoding of the application’s strings are (e.g., from %s/%*.s) to the encoding of the terminal. In almost all cases, this assumption is wrong when you have a capable terminal (such as the new Windows Terminal, or the dozens of terminal emulators that run on Windows). The C Standard for fprintf and its %s modifier specifies no conversions, but it does not explicitly forbid them from doing this, either. They are also under no obligation to properly identify what the input encoding that goes into the terminal is either.For example, even if I put UTF-8 data into fprintf("%s", (const char*)u8"🐈 meow 🐱");, it can assume that the data I put in is not UTF-8 but, in fact, ISO 8859-1 or Mac Cyrillic or GBK. This is, of course, flagrantly wrong for our given example. But, it doesn’t matter: it will misinterpret that data as one kind of encoding and blindly encode it to whatever the internal Terminal encoding is (which is probably UTF-16 or some adjacent flavor thereof).The result is that you will get a bunch of weird symbols or a bunch of empty cells in your terminal, leading to confused users and no Unicode-capable output. So, the cross-platform solution is to use fwrite specifically for data that we expect implementations like Microsoft will mangle on various terminal displays (such as in VSCode, Microsoft Terminal, or just plain ol’ cmd.exe that is updated enough and under the right settings). This bypasses any internal %s decoding that happens, and basically shoves the bytes as-is straight to the terminal. Given it is just a sequence of bytes going to the terminal, it will be decoded directly by the display functions of the terminal and the shown cells, at least for the new Windows Terminal, will show us UTF-8 output.It’s not ideal and it makes the examples a lot less readable and tangible, but that is (unfortunately) how it is.What is with the "foo" string literal but the e.g. \\xF0\\x9F\\x98\\xAD sequence??Let us take yet another look at this very frustrating initialization:You might look at this and be confused. And, rightly, you should be: why not just use a u8"" string literal? And, with that u8"" literal, why not just use e.g. u8"Blah blah\\U0001F62D" to get the crying face? Well, unfortunately, I regret to inform you thatMSVC is At It Again!Let’s start with just using u8"" and trying to put the crying face into the string literal, directly:This seems like the normal way of doing things. Compile on GCC? Works fine. Compile on Clang? Also works fine enough. Compile on MSVC? Well, I hope you brought tissues. If you forget to use the /utf-8 flag, this breaks in fantastic ways. First, it will translate your crying emoji into a sequence of code units that is mangled, at the source level. Then, as the compiler goes forward, a bunch of really fucked up bytes that no longer correspond to the sobbing face emoji (Unicode code point U+0001F62D) will then each individually be treated as its own Unicode code point. So you will get 4 code points, each one more messed up that the last, but it doesn’t stop there, because MSVC — in particular — has a wild behavior. The size of the string literal here won’t be 4 (number of mangled bytes) + 1 (null terminator) to have sizeof(very_normal) be 5. No, the sizeof(very_normal) here is NINE (9)!See, Microsoft did this funny thing where, inside of the u8"", each byte is not considered as part of a sequence. Each byte is considered its own Unicode code point, all by itself. So the 4 fucked up bytes (plus null terminator) are each treated as distinct, individual code points (and not a sequence of code units). Each of these is then expanded out to their UTF-8 representation, one at a time. Since the high bit is set on all of these, each “code point” effectively translates to a double-byte UTF-8 sequence. Now, normally, that’s like… whatever, right? We didn’t specify /utf-8, so we’re getting garbage into our string literal at some super early stage in the lexing of the source. “Aha!”, you say. “I will inject each byte, one at a time, using a \\xHH sequence, where HH is a 0-255 hexadecimal character.” And you would be right on Clang. And right on GCC. And right according to the C and C++ standard. You would even be correct if it was an L"" string literal, where it would insert one code unit corresponding to that sequence. But if you type this:You would not be correct on MSVC.The above code snippet is what folks typically reach for, when they cannot guarantee /utf-8 or /source-charset=.65001 (the Microsoft Codepage name for UTF-8). “If I can just inject the bytes, I can get a u8"" string literal, typed according with unsigned values, converted into my const char[] array.” This makes sense. This is what people do, to have cross-platform source code that will work everywhere, including places that were slow to adopt \\U... sequences. It’s a precise storage of the bytes, and each \\x fits for each character.But it won’t work on MSVC.The sizeof(very_normal) here, even with /utf-8 specified, is still 9. This is because, as the previous example shows up, it treats each code unit here as being a full code point. These are all high-bits-set values, and thus are treated as 2-byte UTF-8 sequences, plus the null terminator. No other compiler does this. MSVC does not have this behavior even for its other string literal types; it’s just with UTF-8 they pull this. So even if you can’t have u8"😭" in your source code — and you try to place it into the string in an entirely agnostic way that gets around bad source encoding — it will still punch you in the face. This is not standards-conforming. It was never standards-conforming, but to be doubly sure the wording around this in both C and C++ was clarified in recent additions to make it extremely clear this is not the right behavior.There are open bug reports against MSVC for this. There were also bug reports against the implementation before they nuked their bug tracker and swapped to the current Visual Studio Voice. I was there, when I was not involved in the standard and code-young to get what was going on. Back when the libogonek author and others tried to file against MSVC about this behavior. Back when the “CTP”s were still a thing MSVC was doing.They won’t fix this. The standard means nothing here; they just don’t give a shit. Could be because of source compatibility reasons. But even if it’s a source compatibility issue, they won’t even lock a standards conforming behavior behind a flag. /permissive- won’t fix it. /utf-8 won’t fix it. There’s no /Zc:unfuck-my-u8-literals-please flag. Nothing. The behavior will remain. It will screw up every piece of testing code you have written to test for specific patterns in your strings while you’re trying to make sure the types are correct. There is nothing you can do but resign yourself to not using u8"" anymore for those use cases.Removing the u8 in front gets the desired result. Using const char very_normal[] = u8"\\U0001F62D"; also works, except that only applies if you’re writing UTF-8 exactly. If you’re trying to set up e.g. an MUTF-8 null terminator (to work with Android/Java UTF-8 strings) inside of your string literal to do a quick operation? If you want to insert some “false” bytes in your test suite’s strings to check if your function works? …Hah.Stack that with the recent char8_t type changes for u8"", and it’s a regular dumpster fire on most platforms to program around for the latest C++ version.Nevertheless!This manages to cover the canonical conversions between most of the known encodings that come out of the C standard:Anything else has the special suffix added, but ultimately it is not incredibly satisfactory. After all, part of the wonderful magic of ztd.text and libogonek is the fact that — at compile-time — they could connect 2 encodings together. Now, there’s likely not a way to fully connect 2 encodings at compile-time in C without some of the most disgusting macros I would ever write being spawned from the deepest pits of hell. And, I would likely need an extension or two, like Blocks or Statement Expressions, to make it work out nicely so that it could be used everywhere a normal function call/expression is expected.Nevertheless, not all is lost. I promised an interface that could automatically connect 2 disparate encodings, similar to how ztd::text::transcode(…) can give to the ability to convert between a freshly-created Shift-JIS and UTF-8 without writing that specific conversion routine yourself. This is critical functionality, because it is the step beyond what Rust libraries like encoding_rs offer, and outstrips what libraries like simdutf, utf8cpp, or Standard C could ever offer. If we do it right, it can even outstrip libiconv, where there is a fixed set of encodings defined by the owner of the libiconv implementation that cannot be extended without recompiling the library and building in new routines. ICU includes functionality to connect two disparate encodings, but the library must be modified/recompiled to include new encoding routines, even if they have the ucnv_ConvertEx function that takes any 2 disparate encodings and transcodes through UChars (UTF-16). Part of the promise of this article was that we could not only achieve maximum speed, but allow for an infinity of conversions within C.So let’s build the C version of all of this.General-Purpose Interconnected Conversions Require GenericityThe collection of the cuneicode functions above are both strongly-typed and the encoding is known. In most cases (save for the internal execution and wide execution encodings, where things may be a bit ambiguous to an end-user (but not for the standard library vendor)), there is no need for any intermediate conversion steps. They do not need any potential intermediate storage because both ends of the transcoding operation are known. libiconv provides us with a good idea for what the input and output needs to look like, but having a generic pivot is a different matter. ICU and a few other libraries have an explicit pivot source; other libraries (like encoding_rs) want you to coordinate the conversion from the disparate encoding to UTF-8 or UTF-16 and then to the destination encoding yourself (and therefore provide your own UTF-8/16 pivot). Here’s how ICU does it in its ucnv_convertEx API:The buffers have to be type-erased, which means either providing void*, aliasing-capable7 char*, or aliasing-capable unsigned char*. (Aliasing is when a pointer to one type is used to look at the data of a fundamentally different type; only char and unsigned char can do that, and std::byte if C++ is on the table.) After we type-erase the buffers so that we can work on a “byte” level, we then need to develop what ICU calls UConverters. Converters effectively handle converting between their desired representation (e.g., SHIFT-JIS or EUC-KR) and transport to a given neutral middle-ground encoding (such as UTF-32, UTF-16, or UTF-8). In the case of ICU, they convert to UChar objects, which are at-least 16-bit sized objects which can hold UTF-16 code units for UTF-16 encoded data. This becomes the Unicode-based anchor through which all communication happens, and why it is named the “pivot”.Pivoting: Getting from A to B, through CICU is not the first library to come up with this. Featured in libiconv, libogonek, my own libraries, encoding_rs (in the examples, but not the API itself), and more, libraries have been using this “pivoting” technique for coming up on a decade and a half now. It is effectively the same platonic ideal of “so long as there is a common, universal encoding that can handle the input data, we will make sure there is an encoding route from A to this ideal intermediate, and then go to B through said intermediate”. Let’s take a look at ucnv_convertEx from ICU again:The pivot is typed as various levels of UChar pointers, where UChar is a stand-in for a type wide enough to hold 16 bits (like uint_least16_t). More specifically, the UChar-based pivot buffer is meant to be the place where UTF-16 intermediate data is stored when there is no direct conversion between two encodings. The iconv library has the same idea, except it does not expose the pivot buffer to you. Emphasis mine:It provides support for the encodings…… [huuuuge list] …It can convert from any of these encodings to any other, through Unicode conversion.— GNU version of libiconv, May 21st, 2023In fact, depending on what library you use, you can be dealing with a “pivot”, “substrate”, or “go-between” encoding that usually ends up being one of UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. Occasionally, non-Unicode pivots can be used as well but they are exceedingly rare as they often do not accommodate characters from both sides of the equation, in a way that Unicode does (or gives room to). Still, just because somebody writes a few decades-old libraries and frameworks around it, doesn’t necessarily prove that pivots are the most useful technique. So, are pivots actually useful?When I wrote my previous article about generic conversions, we used the concept of a UTF-32-based pivot to convert between UTF-8 and Shift-JIS, without either encoding routine knowing about the other. Of course, because this is C and we do not have ugly templates, we cannot use the compile-time checking to make sure the decode_one of one “Lucky 7” object and the encode_one of the other “Lucky 7” object lines up. So, we instead need a system where encodings pairs identify themselves in some way, and then identify that as the pivot point. That is, for this diagram:And make the slight modification that allows for this:The “something” is our indirect encoding, and it will also be used as the pivot. Of course, we still can’t know what that pivot will be, so we will once again use a type-erased bucket of information for that. Ultimately, our final API for doing this will look like this:The _one suffixed function does one-by-one conversions, and the other is for bulk conversions. We can see that the API shape here looks pretty much exactly like libiconv, with the extra addition of the cnc_pivot_info structure for the ability to control how much space is dedicated to the pivot. If p_pivot_info->bytes is a null pointer, or p_pivot_info is, itself, a null pointer, then it will just use some implementation-defined, internal buffer for a pivot. From this single function, we can spawn the entire batch of functionality we initially yearned for in libiconv. But, rather than force you to write nullptr/NULL in the exact-right spot of the cnc_conv_pivot function, we instead just provide you everything you need anyways:It’s a lot of declarations, but wouldn’t you be surprised that the internal implementation of almost all of these is just one function call!It is mostly for convenience to provide these functions. Since the implementation is so simple, it warrants giving people exactly what they want. This is so they can have named functions which communicate what they’re doing in as normal a way, as opposed to using NULL/nullptr splattering that does not communicate anything to an external user why exactly someone is doing that with the function. Still, for as much as I talk these functions up, there’s two very important bits I’ve been sort of skirting around:Well, strap in, because we are going to be crafting a reusable, general-purpose encoding library that allows for run time extension of the available encodings (without loss of speed).cuneicode and the Encoding RegistryAs detailed in Part 1 and hinted at above, libiconv — and many other existing encoding infrastructures — do not provide a way to expand their encoding knowledge at run time. They ship with a fixed set of encodings, and you must either directly modify the library or directly edit data files in order to coax more encodings out of the interface. In the case of Standard C, sometimes that means injecting more files into the system locale files, or other brittle/non-portable things. We need a means of loading up and controlling a central place where we can stuff all our encodings. Not only that, but we also:So, we need to come up with a new entity for the API that we will term a cnc_conversion_registry. As the name implies, it’s a place to store all of our conversions, and thusly a brief outline of the most important parts of the API should look like this:This is a LOT to digest. So, we’re going to walk through it, from top-to-bottom. The first 5 are function type definitions: they define the 5 different core operations an allocator can perform. Following the order of the type definitions:From there, we compose a heap that contains one of each of the above functions, plus a void* which acts as a user data that goes into the heap. The user data’s purpose is to provide any additional information that may be needed contextually by this heap to perform its job (for example, a pointer to an span of memory that is then used as a raw arena). 99% of people will ignore the existence of the heap, however, and just use either cnc_create_default_heap, or just call cnc_new_registry which will create a defaulted heap for you. (The default heap will just shill out to malloc and friends.) The defaulted heap is then passed to cnc_open_registry.Finally, there’s the registry options. Occasionally, it’s useful to create an entirely empty registry, so there’s a cnc_registry_options_empty for that, but otherwise the default is to stuff the registry with all of the pre-existing encodings that the library knows about. So, we can create a registry for this by doing:So far, the usage is surprisingly simple, despite all the stuff we talked about. The cnc_conersion_registry is a never-completed type, because it’s meant to just be a (strongly-typed) handle value (rather than just passing around a void*). The various error codes come from the cnc_open_error enumeration, and the names themselves explain pretty clearly what could happen. Some of the error codes don’t matter for this specific function, because it’s just opening the registry. The most we could run into is a cnc_open_err_allocation_failure or cnc_open_err_invalid_parameter; otherwise, we will just get cnc_open_err_ok! Assuming that we did, in fact, get cnc_open_err_ok, we can move on to the next part, which is opening/newing up a cnc_conversion* from our freshly created cnc_conversion_registry.Creating a cuneicode ConversionDealing with allocations can be a pretty difficult task. As with the cnc_new_registry function, we are going to provide a number of entry points that simply shill out to the heap passed in during registry creation so that, once again, 99% of users do not have to care where their memory comes from for these smaller objects. But, it’s still important to let users override such defaults and control the space: this is paramount to allow for a strictly-controlled embedded implementation that can compile and run the API we are presenting here. So, let’s get into the (thorny) rules of both creating a conversion object, and providing routines to give our own conversion routines. First, let’s start with creating a conversion object to use:As shown with the registry APIs, there’s 2 distinct variants: the _open and _new styles. The _new style pulls its memory from the heap passed in during registry creation. It’s the simplest and easiest and effectively runs with whatever is on the heap at the time. However, sometimes that’s not local-enough for some folks. Therefore, the _open variant of the functions ask for a pointer to a size_t* for the amount of space is available, and a void* space that points to an area of memory that contains at least *p_available_space bytes. Each set of APIs takes a from name and a to name: these are encoding names that are compared in a specific manner. That is:The reason that the rules are like this is so "UTF-8" and "utf-8" and "utf_8" and "Utf-8" are all considered identical. This is different from Standard C and C++, where setlocale and getlocale are not required to do any sort of invariant-folding comparison and instead can consider "C.UTF-8", "C.Utf-8", "c.utf-8" and similar name variations as completely different. That is, while one platform will affirm that "C.UTF-8" is a valid locale/encoding, another platform will reject this despite having the moral, spiritual, and semantic equivalent of "C.UTF-8" because you spelled it with lowercase letters rather than some POSIX-blessed “implementation-defined” nutjobbery. Perhaps in the future I could provide Unicode-based title casing/case folding, but at the moment 99% of encoding names are in mostly-ASCII identifiers. (It could be possible in the future to provide a suite of translated names for the to and from codes, but that is a bridge we can cross at a later date.)The _n and non-_n style of functions are just variations on providing a size for the from and to names; this makes it easy not to require allocation if you parse a name out of another format (e.g., passing in a validated sub-input that identifies the encoding from a buffer that contains an <?xml … ?> encoding tag in an XHTML file, or the <meta> tag). If you don’t call the _n functions, we do the C thing and call strlren on the input from and to buffers. (This is, obviously, a problem if the string is not 0-terminated as is the case with directly accessing a region of memory inside of the raw loaded text that represents a <meta> tag or a #pragma file_encoding "kz1048".) It’s not great, but momentum is momentum: C programmers and the APIs they use/sit beneath them on their systems expect footgun-y null terminated strings, no matter how many times literally everyone gets it wrong in their lifespan as a C or C++ programmer.Now that we know all of this, we can start talking about direct matches and indirect matches and the cnc_conversion_info structure:The (to|from)_code_(data/size) fields should be self-explanatory: when the conversion from from to to is found, it hands the user the sized strings of the found conversions. These names should compare equal under the function ztdc_is_encoding_name_equal_n_c8(…) to the from/to code passed in to any of the cnc_conv_new_*/cnc_conv_open_* functions. Note it may not be identical (even if they are considered equivalent) as mentioned with the “normalizing” algorithm above. The names provided in the cnc_conversion_info structure are what is stored inside of the registry, and not the name provided to the function call.The interesting bit is the is_indirect boolean value and the indirect_code_(data/size) fields. If is_indirect is true, then the indirect_ fields will be populated with the name (and the size of the name) of the indirect encoding that is used as a pivot between the two encoding pairs!Indirect Encoding ConnectionIf we are going to have a way to connect two entirely disparate encodings through a common medium, then we need to be able to direct an encoding through an intermediate. This is where indirect conversions come in. The core idea is, thankfully, not complex, and works as follows:So, for a brief second, if we assumed we have an encoding conversion from an encoding called “SHIFT-JIS” to “UTF-32”, and we had an encoding from “UTF-32” to “UTF-8”, we could simply ask to go from “Shift-JIS” to “UTF-8” without explicitly writing that encoding conversion ourselves. Since cuneicode comes with an encoding conversion that does Shift-JIS ➡ UTF-32 and UTF-32 ➡ UTF-8, we can try out the following code ourselves and verify it works with the APIs we have been discussing up until now. This is the exact same example we had back in the C++ article.Step one is to open a registry:That’s the first step. If we fail to open a conversion registry, we return 2 out of main and bail. Otherwise, this gets us an entirely empty registry. Normally, we would use cnc_registry_options_default to have the registry filled with all of the existing conversions that exist in cuneicode added to the registry by-default, but we’re going to use the fact that its empty to test that there does not exist a conversion between the 2 encodings we want to work with. That test looks like this:If this passes, we know we have a registry that does not have a conversion. Good. Now we can test if our idea of an indirect conversion is real. In order to do that, we’re going to need some APIs for adding conversions to the registry. There are a LOT and they are all documented in the ztd.cuneicode documentation; the ones we are going to focus on will be the cnc_registry_add_single(…) and cnc_registry_add_alias(…), which look like this:To start, there’s a somewhat complex function signature for cnc_conversion_functions. Most of those parameters should be recognizable from the previous definitions we talked about earlier, with the addition of a single extra void* called p_state. This is an advanced parameter that we will not be talking about here, which is for managing state in a conversion and encoding-agnostic manner. Because Shift-JIS, UTF-32, and UTF-8 do not require state with the way our API is structured, we will not need to use it. We will also not need to touch the *p_pivot_info either, as we will not be attempting to use any sort of “temporary buffer space” (what the p_pivot_info is meant to control) in order to do the conversion. We will be using the static conversion functions that know which encodings they are going to, and which they are coming from, and we will know before hand that they do not need any state. That will make our implementation of the cnc_conversion_function* single_conversion_function very simple.The last three parameters to cnc_registry_add_single are also advanced parameters that we will not be covering here. Because we have no state we are interested in, we can pass NULL for the state_is_complete_fuinction. Similarly, because there is no extra data or state we need to maintain inside the cnc_conversion* opaque handle, we will not need either an open_function or a close_function to describe the format of the memory that is contained within. Therefore, we will pass NULL and NULL to these parameters, too. The rest of the parameters — registry, from, and to — are straightforward manifestations of what we expect. We want the registry we are going to put the conversion into, the (null-terminated) name to register on the “from” side of the encoding, and the (null-terminated) name of the encoding on the “to” side.The cnc_registry_add_alias function is meant to behave exactly as you expect: if someone asks for the name pointed to by alias, it will instead give them the name at original. This is to add common names to more descriptive encodings so that the usual existing names can map usefully on any given platform. Note that, like the APIs above, there are other versions such as cnc_add_registry_single_n and cnc_registry_add_alias_n so that counted strings can be used for the names as opposed to null-terminated strings, similar to the other APIs talked about above.Now that we’ve established that, it’s time for the fun bit: writing a type-erased cnc_conversion_function that does a single indivisible unit of encoding work.“Single” ConversionsAs described in the last article, there is — in a generally-applicable, widely-applied way — a way to convert between doing “bulk” work to make it do a “single” unit of work, and a way to stack a “single” unit of work to make it do “bulk” work. The performance of these approaches is bloody AWFUL. But! It will work. This is why we are using cnc_registry_add_single: the name is a clue that we are going to only provide a function which does a single unit of indivisible work. Then, the API — automatically — is going to take that single function and then proceed to run it in a hard loop, over and over again, until it either errors or consumes all of the input data. “Consumes all of the input data” also includes any data accumulated on the state; this is what the cnc_state_is_complete function is for. Again, our encodings have no state, so we will just be providing NULL for the completion function and other related information to let them default internally, but that is its purpose.So, we just have to implement the single conversion and the library will automatically take care of the rest for us, which is pretty nice! Going above the main function in the same file, we start with the following skeletons:Okay, so far so good. Let’s start with the shift_jis_x0208_to_utf32 function, and fill it in.Shift-JIS to UTF-32There is a LOT to consider, so we will take it piece by piece:Nothing too complex, here. We are setting up a BUNCH of variables for us to use. Notably, we are trying to get strongly-typed pointers out of the existing byte-based ones, since internally we want to work with whole, complete code units and code points rather than going through everything byte-by-byte. As stated before, we are ignoring state, conversion, and p_pivot_info, since we know everything about the conversions we are going to do.This is a lot of work to do a little, but it is, thankfully, very simple work that gets complicated by trying to be pedantically correct, the worst kind of correct. So:That covers all of the steps above. Again, a lot of noise just to be pedantic, but it never hurts to not lead anyone down the stray path, right? Now that we have our proper pointers and proper sizes, we get to do the hard part: converting between Shift-JIS and UTF-32. That part looks like this:Yeah, of course I’m cheating! Do you really want to see me write a Shift-JIS converter in the middle of this function? Absolutely not: I did not convert these pointers to something usable just to ignore something I already implemented: we call into the static conversion function and go on about our day like normal creatures that have better things to do. The rest of the function is just converting back to byte sizes and byte pointers and having a good time:You can imagine that the implementation for utf32_to_utf8 uses much the same mechanisms: we convert to concrete pointers, assert that they are aligned, and then pass it into the pre-existing cnc_mcntoc32n_utf8 function that cuneicode has. Again, it’s not a crash course in UTF-32 to UTF-8 conversion, but we’re always meant to work smarter, not harder. I am not implementing these conversions for the eightieth time in my life just to score points on a technical writeup.Back to mainWith that out of the way, we can get back to our main function and start using these functions to do a type-erased conversion in for our encoding registry. Let’s add the 2 conversions to our registry now:Very straightforward. We add the Shift-JIS to UTF-32, and then the UTF-32 to UTF-8 conversion routine. We want to be able to access Shift-JIS at standard X0208 by just using the name “Shift-JIS”, so we connect it using an alias:Past this point, we just need to actually create the conversion and attempt the actual work. We tested before that the conversion did NOT work, so now we will require that it does work (otherwise, we bail from main with the error code 7):As before, the conversion_info variable has been filled in at this point, so now we can use it to get information about what we opened up into the cnc_conversion* handle:Executing the code up until this point, we’ll get something like:which is what we were expecting. Right now, cuneicode only has a conversion routine between Shift-JIS ⬅➡ UTF-32, so it only has one “indirect” encoding to pick from. The rest of this code should look familiar to the example given above for the compile-time known encoding conversions, save for the fact that we are passing values through unsigned char* rather than any strongly-typed const char* or char8_t* types. That means we need to get the array sizes in bytes (not that it matters too much, since the input and output values are in char and unsigned char arrays):Finally. That’s it. So, now we can run all of this, and so, we can see the following output from the whole program:Nice!A general-purpose pivoting mechanism that can choose an intermediate and allow us to transcode through it, that we created ourselves! That means we have covered most of what is inside of the table even when we use an encoding that is as obnoxious to write an implementation against such as Punycode. Of course, despite demonstrating it can go through an indirect/intermediate encoding, that does not necessarily prove that we can do that for any encoding we want. The algorithm inside of cuneicode prefers conversions to and from UTF-32, UTF-8, and UTF-16 before any other encoding, but after that it’s a random grab bag of whichever matching encoding pair is discovered first.This can, of course, be a problem. You may want to bias the selection of the intermediate encoding one way or another; to solve this problem, we just have to add another function call that takes a “filtering”/”selecting” function.Indirect Control: Choosing an Indirect EncodingBecause this is C, we just add some more prefixes/suffixes on to the existing collection of function names, so we end up with a variant of cnc_conv_new that is instead named cnc_conv_new_select and its friends:A cnc_indirect_selection_function type effectively takes the from name, the to name, and the indirect name and passes them to a function that returns a bool. This allows a function to wait for e.g. a specific indirect name to select, or maybe will reject any conversion that features an indirect conversion at all (the indirect name will be a null pointer to signify that it’s a direct conversion). For example, here’s a function that will only allow direct conversions or Unicode-based go-betweens:This function might come in handy to guarantee, for example, that there’s a maximum chance that 2 encodings could convert between each other. Typically, Unicode’s entire purpose is to enable going from one encoded set of text to another without any loss, whether through publicly available/assigned code points or through usage of the private use area. A user can further shrink this surface area by demanding that the go-between is something like UTF-8. This can come particularly in handy for UTF-EBCDIC which has many bit-level similarities with UTF-8 that can be used for optimization purposes as a go-between.cuneicode itself, when a version of the cnc_conv_(open|new) is used, provides a function that simply just returns true. This is because cuneicode, internally, has special mechanisms that directly scans a subset of the list of known Unicode encodings and checks them first. If there’s a conversion routine stored in the registry to or from for UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, it will select and prioritize those first before going on to let the function pick whatever happens to be the first one. The choice is unspecified and not stable between invocations of the cnc_conv creation functions, but that’s because I’m reserving the right to improve the storage of the conversion routines in the registry and thus might need to change the data structures and their iteration paths / qualities in the future.So There We Have ItWe have an API that can:This satisfies all our requirements, and has an API that can work on even the tiniest devices to-boot. (We did not go over the allocation-less API’s that are signified by the _open functions; this will be the subject of a deep-dive for a later blog post.) So, now it comes time to fill in our tables from the last blog post about the functionality. It should come as no surprise that we check all the boxes, because we built it to check all the boxes.There’s more API surface that we have not covered in this code. For example, there’s functions that help do error handling (e.g. replacement characters with skipping bad input, among other things). However, because this is C, this creates a combinatoric explosion of API surface: there needs to be so, SO many functions to handle it. One of the ways to mitigate this would be to use a combination of macros with Statement Expressions and similar to do better. Unfortunately, statement expressions are non-standard. What we do instead is create some pretty disgusting abominations with macros… though! Even though they are disgusting abominations, it actually ends up working somewhat decently (for now):I will not show the implementation of this, because quite frankly it’s downright sinful. It’s the kind of stuff I’d have to go to confession for, but… well. I’m not going to the pearly gates yet, so I won’t have to account for the things I’ve done. I am not supposed to feel bad for the code I have written, nor for the state of the world as it relates to text in C and C++ … And yet? If I can be honest with you, dear reader…I Feel My Sins Crawling On My BackThe sad reality is that I attempted to standardize at least a portion of this work (not the generic indirect conversions and encoding registry part) in C, for C23. I failed. So even as I sit here, lamenting the state of the ecosystem, angry at glibc, perpetually pissed off about Windows’s ucrt.dll, angry at Standard C and Standard C++?The reality is that I’m no better.This was my responsibility to fix it, to see it through to the end. It was, in fact, the sole reason I came down to work on C in the first place. Becoming Project Editor, helping with enums, doing #embed, fixing initialization with = {}, typeof, and so much more…. that was extra. Unplanned. Unicode conversion functions was the one thing I did plan. This is the one thing I had the most knowledge about, a solid game plan for. Numerous individuals pulled through for me, even submitted National Body comments on my behalf so this could be cleaned up in time.I still didn’t make it happen.It also had knock-on effects: without these functions, we also did not get u8/u16/u32 specifiers for the fprintf family of functions. The conversions were hard to specify without the functions being there (again, because I did not succeed in my mission). So not only did I fail in my mission, but my failure became other people’s problems. Just my one thing I failed to do, and it kept on going. And going.And going.This means we miss a whole cycle; no Unicode functionality in C for another spin of the standardization wheel. And, because the C++ library imports all C functions de-facto and de-jure, C++ does not get it either. This only makes me shudder more, because the deadline for the next version of the C standard is not set in stone. Some are advocating we take another 10 years to roll out the next version of the C standard with more features. Another 10 years with no cross-platform printing mechanism. Another 10 years without even the static functions going between Unicode encodings and freeing people from their locale / wide locale-sensitive conversion functions. Another 10 years of functions which are not thread-safe.10 years of getting to watch the ecosystem continue to slide into hell, because I couldn’t get my words on a paper correct so I couldn’t put it in the magic sky document.10 years of responsibility.Ten. Years.Mn.Well. Not everything can go perfect, right? But, there is more to discuss than my abject inability to get the job done for just static, Unicode-centric conversions in C. In particular, one of the things hinted at by Part 1 was this interface — despite it doing things like updating the input/output pointers as well as the input/output sizes — could be fast. Now that we have both the static conversion sections and the registry for this C library, is it possible to be fast? Can we compete with the Big Dogs™ like ICU and encoding_rs for their conversion routines? Where does standard C and C++ fit on the scale? And, well, here’s what it looks like:But we’ll discuss these benchmarks more… Next time. If you’ve stuck around to read this whole giant article, wow, nice job!

This makes it easier to write bug-free code.\\n\\nOne of the key features of Cuneicode is its support for Unicode. Unicode is a character encoding standard that allows us to represent characters from different languages and scripts. Cuneicode supports Unicode natively, which means that we can write code that handles text in any language.\\n\\nCuneicode also provides a rich set of string manipulation functions that make it easier to work with text. These functions are designed to be safe and efficient, which means that they are less prone to buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the challenges that C and C++ APIs present when it comes to handling text. C and C++ APIs were designed in an era when ASCII was the dominant character encoding standard. As a result, these APIs are not well-suited for handling text in different languages and scripts.\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges with C and C++ APIs is that they are not Unicode-aware. This means that they cannot handle characters that are outside the ASCII range. To work around this limitation, developers have to use complex and error-prone techniques such as multi-byte encodings and wide-character strings.\\n\\nAnother challenge with C and C++ APIs is that they are prone to buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities. This is because these APIs do not perform bounds checking on string operations. As a result, it is easy to write code that overflows a buffer and causes a security vulnerability.\\n\\nCuneicode addresses these challenges by providing a modern, Unicode-aware API for handling text. Cuneicode's API is designed to be safe and efficient, which means that it is less prone to security vulnerabilities. Cuneicode also provides a rich set of string manipulation functions that make it easier to work with text.\\n\\nLet's take a look at some code examples to see how Cuneicode works. Here's a simple program that reads a file and prints its contents to the console:\\n\\n```\\n#include <cuneicode.h>\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main() {\\n  FILE* file = fopen(\\"example.txt\\", \\"r\\");\\n  if (file == NULL) {\\n    printf(\\"Error: could not open file\\\\n\\");\\n    return 1;\\n  }\\n\\n  cuni_string_t* contents = cuni_string_new();\\n  char buffer[1024];\\n  while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file) != NULL) {\\n    cuni_string_append_cstr(contents, buffer);\\n  }\\n\\n  printf(\\"%s\\", cuni_string_cstr(contents));\\n  cuni_string_free(contents);\\n  fclose(file);\\n  return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we use the `cuni_string_t` type to handle the file contents. This type is a Unicode-aware string type that is provided by Cuneicode. We read the file contents into a buffer using the `fgets` function, and then append the buffer to the `cuni_string_t` using the `cuni_string_append_cstr` function. Finally, we print the contents of the `cuni_string_t` using the `cuni_string_cstr` function.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Cuneicode is a promising new programming language that aims to revolutionize the way we handle text in C. Its support for Unicode and modern, safe API make it a great choice for developers who want to work with text in different languages and scripts. As developers, we should keep an eye on Cuneicode and its development, as it has the potential to become the future of text in C."}

For instance, to replace all occurrences of foo with bar in input.txt, you would use:Sometimes you may want to edit the original file rather than create a new one. In that case, use the -i/--in-place option.By default, sed prints all processed input, reflecting any modifications made. You can suppress this output with the -n/--quiet/--silent option. In that case, you need to run specific commands to get any output at all, like the p command:Remember to quote the script ('') when using sed in a shell.Command StructureAt its core, a sed script consists of one or more commands. These commands follow the basic syntax [addr]x[options], where:'3 s/foo/bar/g' will search for the word foo on line 3 and replace it with bar. Not too difficult, right?An address can also be a range. That is, a pair of two addresses separated by a comma. In that case, the command will execute for every line within the range. The following example deletes lines 30 to 35 from a file:sed ‘30,35d’ input.txt > output.txtYou can even use a regular expression address to create interesting commands like this one, which prints all input until a line starting with foo is found:sed ‘/^foo/q’ input.txt > output.txtWhen dealing with multiple sed commands, they can be separated by either semicolons (;) or newline characters:sed ‘/^foo/d ; s/hello/world/g’ input.txt > output.txtHow sed worksLet’s take a closer look at how sed works behind the scenes.Sed operates using two data buffers, which you can think of as internalvariables: the “pattern space” and the “hold space”. These two buffers play a prominent role in sed’s execution, which occurs in cycles:Unlike the “pattern space”, the “hold space” keeps its data between cycles. The “hold space” remains usually empty and unused for the entire execution, unless special commands (like h, H, g, G) are used to move data between the buffers). It’s not actually empty — It’s initialized on the first cycle with a single newline (\\n) character.Commands OverviewHere’s a list of every command. It shows what happens when they run.You’ll notice that some commands print to the output stream, some commands modify the “pattern space”, and a few commands interact with the “hold space.”Also, some commands jump to somewhere else in the execution cycle after running. Most notably the “goto-like” commands: b, t and T.To use a “goto-like” label, you first need to define it with the : LABEL command. Then, jumping to LABEL will take you to that place in the execution.The brackets {} are technically commands too. You can use them to group a set of commands so that they execute after a single address.Gigachad-tip: Broadly speaking, the uppercase commands are a way to do multi-line processing, and the “goto-like” commands are a way to compensate for the lack of “if/then” and loop constructs in sed. But honestly, if you need this kind of functionality, you are better off with tools like awk, Perl or Python.Example: Getting book authorsLet’s look at an advanced example.This sed script operates on a list of books in the library.txt format. It finds authors of books with the word “the” in the title and a high star rating.Let’s follow its execution.In the first cycle, none of the addresses match:Same for the second cycle:On the third cycle, the first address matches. So we execute some commands and store information in the “hold space:”On the fourth cycle, the first address matches, so we append more information to the “hold space:”Also, the “last line” address matches, so we run commands to clean and print the “hold space:”Here’s the output of the entire script:Closing thoughtsProgramming in sed feels like operating one level of abstraction too deep. It’s like taking an elevator to the ground floor and somehow ending in the basement.I guess this is how programmers used to think back in the 60s, when they were closer to the metal.I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it were revealed that our sed scripts are actually running in a higher plane of existence, and we are just the puppets of some intelligence that can account for the bizarre behavior of sed.If you liked this guide, feel free to check my visual guide to grep:A Visual Guide to GrepMastering The Universal Search Toolbetterprogramming.pubThanks for reading!

Sed is a command-line tool that allows you to perform text substitution, just like the \\"Find and Replace\\" feature in GUI editors. While there are newer tools like sd that offer a better user experience, learning sed is still worthwhile for developers who want to have a deeper understanding of text processing.\\n\\nAt its core, sed is a non-interactive text editor that comes with a built-in Turing machine. This means that you can even run games like Tetris on it! However, mastering sed takes some time, and this guide aims to help you get started with the basics.\\n\\nInvocation and Basic Syntax\\n\\nThe typical invocation of sed is sed SCRIPT FILE. For example, to replace all occurrences of \\"foo\\" with \\"bar\\" in a file called input.txt, you would use the following command:\\n\\n```\\nsed 's/foo/bar/g' input.txt\\n```\\n\\nThe \\"s\\" in the command stands for \\"substitute\\", and the \\"g\\" at the end stands for \\"global\\", which means that sed will replace all occurrences of \\"foo\\" with \\"bar\\" in the file.\\n\\nBy default, sed prints all processed input, reflecting any modifications made. You can suppress this output with the -n/--quiet/--silent option. In that case, you need to run specific commands to get any output at all, like the \\"p\\" command:\\n\\n```\\nsed -n 's/foo/bar/p' input.txt\\n```\\n\\nHere, the \\"p\\" command tells sed to print only the lines that have been modified.\\n\\nCommands and Addressing\\n\\nA sed script consists of one or more commands that follow the basic syntax [addr]x[options]. The \\"addr\\" part specifies the lines to which the command applies, and the \\"x\\" part specifies the action to be performed. For example, the command:\\n\\n```\\n3s/foo/bar/g\\n```\\n\\nwill search for the word \\"foo\\" on line 3 and replace it with \\"bar\\". You can also specify a range of lines by separating two addresses with a comma. For example, the command:\\n\\n```\\n2,5s/foo/bar/g\\n```\\n\\nwill replace all occurrences of \\"foo\\" with \\"bar\\" on lines 2 through 5.\\n\\nHere are some of the most commonly used sed commands:\\n\\n- \\"s\\": substitute\\n- \\"d\\": delete\\n- \\"p\\": print\\n- \\"a\\": append\\n- \\"i\\": insert\\n\\nFor example, the command:\\n\\n```\\nsed '2,5d' input.txt\\n```\\n\\nwill delete lines 2 through 5 from the file.\\n\\nRegular Expressions\\n\\nOne of the most powerful features of sed is its support for regular expressions. Regular expressions allow you to search for patterns in text, rather than just exact matches. Here are some examples of regular expressions that you can use with sed:\\n\\n- \\".\\" matches any character\\n- \\"^\\" matches the beginning of a line\\n- \\"$\\" matches the end of a line\\n- \\"[abc]\\" matches any of the characters \\"a\\", \\"b\\", or \\"c\\"\\n- \\"[a-z]\\" matches any lowercase letter\\n- \\"[A-Z]\\" matches any uppercase letter\\n- \\"[0-9]\\" matches any digit\\n\\nFor example, the command:\\n\\n```\\nsed 's/^foo/bar/g' input.txt\\n```\\n\\nwill replace all occurrences of \\"foo\\" at the beginning of a line with \\"bar\\".\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nSed is a powerful tool that can help you perform text substitution and processing tasks quickly and efficiently. While it may take some time to master, learning sed is a valuable skill for any developer who works with text files. In this guide, we covered the basics of sed, including its invocation, syntax, commands, addressing, and regular expressions. With this knowledge, you can start using sed to automate your text processing tasks and become a more efficient developer."}

However, there is no need to fret! This blog post endeavors to explore the realm of refactoring, whereby we untangle our chaotic code and transfigure it into an elegant, modular, and comprehensible solution.Before we start, what is spaghetti code?Spaghetti code refers to source code that is messy and difficult to understand. It has a tangled structure, making it hard to maintain and likely to have errors.Let’s explore an example of spaghetti code:Let’s approach the situation step by step and try to untangle the mess.Identify the ProblemOne of the initial issues we face is the lack of meaningful variable names. Meaningful and descriptive names greatly enhance code readability. To untangle the code, our first step is to rename variables so that they accurately represent their purpose, making the code self-explanatory. This best practice improves our own understanding and helps future developers working on the code.The code’s lack of modularity is evident in the oversized Main function that performs multiple tasks. To tackle this problem, we will break down the Main function and identify separate functionalities. These will be extracted into their own functions or classes. This approach allows us to group related logic together, promote code reusability, and enhance the overall structure of the codebase.Another important aspect that needs improvement is the code’s limited error handling. Effective error handling is crucial for identifying and gracefully recovering from unexpected situations. To address this, we will examine potential exceptions that may occur during the code’s execution. We will then implement appropriate error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to ensure the code handles exceptions smoothly and provides helpful error messages.The code contains numerous complex if-else conditions, making it difficult to read and understand. To simplify this, we will utilize techniques like switch statements, polymorphism, or design patterns such as the strategy pattern. These approaches help streamline conditional logic and reduce its complexity. By doing so, we improve the code’s readability, maintainability, and make it easier to modify in the future.Break it DownTo begin untangling the code, our first step is to split it into smaller, manageable chunks. This allows us to focus on specific functionalities and improve modularity. By breaking down the code into smaller parts, we can isolate and understand individual components more effectively, making it easier to maintain and enhance the codebase.To improve the modularity of the code, we can start by separating the logic responsible for determining the number type and the logic for printing numbers into separate functions or classes.Use Descriptive NamesTo enhance code readability and maintainability, it’s essential to give meaningful names to variables and methods. Let’s apply this practice to the code by assigning appropriate names to the relevant elements.From:To:Use Design Patterns and PrinciplesTo enhance code readability and reduce the complexity of conditionals, we can employ the Strategy Pattern. The Strategy Pattern allows us to encapsulate different algorithms or strategies and dynamically select one at runtime. Here’s how we can apply the Strategy Pattern to replace complex conditionals:From:To:By utilizing the Strategy Pattern, we achieve a more modular and maintainable code structure. It simplifies the complex conditional logic, improves code readability, and makes it easier to extend or modify the behavior in the future.Improve Error HandlingThe original code had minimal error handling. Let’s improve that.From:To:Final TouchesWe can enhance readability by using string interpolation.From:To:And there you have it! Our final, refactored code is clear, modular, and “easy” to understand.Cyclomatic ComplexityCyclomatic Complexity (CC) is a metric that measures the complexity of a program. It quantifies the number of independent paths through the program’s source code. For simple if-else constructs, you can estimate the cyclomatic complexity by counting the decision points (such as if, while, for statements) and adding one.In the old code:Adding them up and adding one, the cyclomatic complexity is 9.In the new code:The cyclomatic complexity of the new code is 4.Reducing cyclomatic complexity simplifies the code, reduces the likelihood of errors, and improves maintainability.FinallyIn conclusion, through refactoring, we’ve made our code more maintainable, easier to understand, and reduced the cyclomatic complexity from 9 to 4. It’s a solid win for any developer.Remember, great code is not about how complex you can make it, but how simple you can make it. As Albert Einstein said, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler”. Happy coding!P.S.

In this article, we will delve into the two primary memory locations for object allocation in C#: the heap and the stack. By grasping these concepts, you’ll be equipped with valuable insights that can help you write high-performance C# applications.\\n\\nHeap vs. Stack: Unveiling the Allocation Paradigm\\n\\nIn C#, objects can be stored either on the heap or the stack, and comprehending the differences between these two memory locations is essential. The stack is used for storing value types and reference types that are declared as local variables or method parameters. When a method is called, a new stack frame is created to store the method's local variables and parameters. When the method returns, the stack frame is popped, and the memory is automatically deallocated.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the heap is used for storing reference types that are created using the \\"new\\" keyword, and it's the responsibility of the garbage collector to free up the memory when it's no longer needed. The heap is a larger memory space than the stack, and it's not organized in a specific order like the stack.\\n\\nAllocating Objects: Reference Types and Value Types\\n\\nNow that we understand the basics of heap and stack memory, let’s explore how different types of objects are allocated in C#. Value types are allocated on the stack, and they are passed by value. Reference types, on the other hand, are allocated on the heap, and they are passed by reference.\\n\\nStarting with C# 7.2, you can declare a struct as a ref struct, ensuring it is always allocated on the stack and preventing it from being declared inside reference types. This can be useful for performance-critical scenarios where you want to avoid heap allocations.\\n\\nReference Semantics for Value Types\\n\\nWhile value types are typically passed by copy, C# provides mechanisms to allow accessing value types by reference, thus introducing reference semantics. The \\"ref\\" and \\"out\\" keywords can be used to pass value types by reference. The \\"in\\" keyword can be used to pass value types by reference without allowing them to be modified.\\n\\nMemory Management: Garbage Collection and the Heap\\n\\nOne of the critical aspects of managing memory in C# is understanding how the heap memory is freed up. When an object on the heap no longer has any references pointing to it, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. At a certain point, the garbage collector kicks in, interrupts running threads, invokes the finalizers of the objects it needs to collect (on a special finalizer thread), and then marks the memory as available for reuse.\\n\\nThe Large Object Heap (LOH): A Special Memory Space\\n\\nIn C#, the heap is further divided into the Small Object Heap (SOH) and the Large Object Heap (LOH). This separation is primarily to address memory fragmentation and optimize memory usage. The SOH is used for objects smaller than 85,000 bytes, while the LOH is used for larger objects.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Small Object Heap (SOH) and the Large Object Heap (LOH) is vital for memory optimization in your C# applications, as it allows you to make informed decisions regarding object size and memory allocation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, understanding object allocation in C# is crucial for writing high-performance applications. By grasping the differences between the heap and the stack, you can optimize memory usage and ensure efficient code execution.

In this article, we will explore some tips and tricks to improve the Button component in React.\\n\\nTo start, let's look at the basic Button component that we will build upon:\\n\\n```\\nexport function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<\\"button\\">) {\\n  return (\\n    <button {...props}>\\n      {props.children}\\n    </button>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAssuming that the buttons are unstyled, which is the default for many CSS frameworks like Tailwind, we can use some sane defaults for the design. Placing the Button component on a page without any additional props or parameters should result in a button that fits in the design and is easily recognizable as a button.\\n\\nA recognizable button tends to follow these design characteristics:\\n\\n- Horizontal padding is twice the vertical padding\\n- High contrast colors are reserved for important buttons\\n- Limit the number of buttons with eye-catching colors\\n\\nWe can achieve these defaults by adding some CSS to the Button component:\\n\\n```\\nexport function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<\\"button\\">) {\\n  return (\\n    <button\\n      {...props}\\n      className=\\"px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50\\"\\n    >\\n      {props.children}\\n    </button>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis CSS uses Tailwind classes to set the horizontal padding, background color, and border radius. It also adds some hover and focus styles to make the button more interactive.\\n\\nAnother important consideration is the default type of the `<button>` element. By default, the type is \\"submit,\\" which can cause issues if the button is not intended to submit a form. To avoid this, we can set the type to \\"button\\" by default:\\n\\n```\\nexport function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<\\"button\\">) {\\n  return (\\n    <button\\n      {...props}\\n      type={props.type ?? \\"button\\"}\\n      className=\\"px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50\\"\\n    >\\n      {props.children}\\n    </button>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code uses the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to set the type to \\"button\\" if it is not already set.\\n\\nFinally, we can add some additional props to make the Button component more flexible. For example, we can add a `size` prop to set the font size and padding:\\n\\n```\\nexport function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<\\"button\\"> & { size?: \\"sm\\" | \\"md\\" | \\"lg\\" }) {\\n  const { size = \\"md\\", ...rest } = props;\\n  const fontSize = size === \\"sm\\" ? \\"text-sm\\" : size === \\"lg\\" ? \\"text-lg\\" : \\"text-base\\";\\n  const padding = size === \\"sm\\" ? \\"px-2 py-1\\" : size === \\"lg\\" ? \\"px-6 py-4\\" : \\"px-4 py-2\\";\\n  return (\\n    <button\\n      {...rest}\\n      type={rest.type ?? \\"button\\"}\\n      className={`text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50 ${fontSize} ${padding}`}\\n    >\\n      {rest.children}\\n    </button>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code adds a `size` prop that can be set to \\"sm,\\" \\"md,\\" or \\"lg\\" to adjust the font size and padding. It also uses some conditional logic to set the appropriate classes based on the size prop.\\n\\nIn conclusion, creating a Button component in React requires careful consideration of the design and flexibility. By using some sane defaults, setting the default type to \\"button,\\" and adding some additional props, we can create a Button component that is both easy to use and flexible enough to fit various use cases."}
59	Analyzing dependencies of JavaScript snippets	https://kabirgoel.com/p/parse-deps	published	reddit	28 May 2023Analyzing dependencies of JavaScript snippetsWhere I befriend Babel to parse out identifiers referenced in code.I’m working on a way to build apps using a spreadsheet-like system called Smoothie. In place of formulas, Smoothie allows you to write arbitrary JavaScript snippets that can reference other cells.\nTo run a snippet, Smoothie wraps it in a function and calls the function. But that’s not enough. Consider this snippet:\nreturn A1 + B2 * 5\nIf we just wrap this in a function and call it, we’ll get an error:\n;(function () { return A1 + B2 * 5})()\nReferenceError: A1 is not defined\nYou can probably see that A1 and B2 need to be in scope to evaluate this expression. We can make them available by passing them as arguments:\n;(function (A1, B2) { return A1 + B2 * 5})(A1, B2)\nIt’s clear to us that A1 and B2 need to be passed, but how can we program the computer to figure that out for us? The problem we’re faced with is parsing out the dependencies of a snippet of code. Let’s dig into the details.\nUnderstanding the problem\nOn a cursory look, it seems like a simple approach could work: split on spaces and collect the parts that look like identifiers, perhaps using a regex. But this kind of approach breaks down on complex code. Consider this multiline snippet that takes parses B1 into a number, adds A1, and returns a status message:\nconst sum = (a, b) => Promise.resolve(a + b)let B2{ const B1 = parseInt(B1.value) B2 = await sum(B1, A1)}return `${B2} is the sum of ${B1} and ${A1}.`\nFrom this example, it should be clear that splitting on spaces won’t work. There’s too much going on syntactically.\nIn addition, the meaning of the program also complicates things:\nB1 is read on the RHS of line 4 and and then bound on the LHS.\nB2 is bound without first being read, “shadowing” the cell B2, so even though it looks like a dependency, it isn’t.\nThere are references to globals like Promise and parseInt, which are irrelevant for this use case.[1]\nAccounting for these nuances, the dependencies of this snippet are B1 and A1. Our approach needs to be able to deal with this kind of complexity.\nA better approach\nIt’s literally impossible to use a pattern-based approach to analyze a language as complex as JavaScript, so you’d certainly go crazy trying.[2] Instead, we can use a library to parse the snippet into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and traverse it to find identifiers. The Babel parser is the most popular way to do AST traversals of this kind. (There’s also acorn, but its included types are incomplete, and that seems unlikely to change.)\nLet’s try and use the Babel parser to reliably figure out what identifiers our snippet needs:\nimport { parse } from "@babel/parser"import traverse from "@babel/traverse"const ast = parse("return A1 + B2 * 5", { strictMode: true, allowAwaitOutsideFunction: true, allowReturnOutsideFunction: true,})const identifiers = []traverse(ast, { Identifier(path) { const { name } = path.node identifiers.push(name) },})console.log(identifiers)\nThis simple script outputs ["A1", "B2"]. Neat! The script run in Natto with modifications as necessary. The pane on the left shows the AST.\nUnfortunately, this implementation is still flawed. Naively collecting all identifiers includes irrelevant ones, such as:\nProperties of objects, due to member expressions like D4.value; both D4 and value are included.\nTargets of variable declarations, like x in const x = 5.\nFortunately, the Babel handbook tells us there’s a generic way to deal with all of these cases in one go. Just add a check for path.isReferencedIdentifier():\ntraverse(ast, { Identifier(path) { const { name } = path.node if (!path.isReferencedIdentifier()) { return } identifiers.push(name) },})\nThis accounts for those edge cases.\nBecause I also want to ignore globals like Promise and limit dependencies to A1-style cell references, I added a few more checks. Here’s what I ended up with:\nimport { parse } from "@babel/parser"import traverse from "@babel/traverse"import { es2020 } from "globals"function isReference(str: string): boolean { return /^[A-Z]\\d+$/.test(str)}/** * Parse a string of code to find its dependencies. * @param str A string of code. * @returns A list of cell names that the code depends on. */export default function parseDeps(str: string): string[] { let ast try { ast = parse(str, { strictMode: true, allowAwaitOutsideFunction: true, plugins: ["estree"], sourceType: "script", }) } catch { return [] } // Collect dependencies by traversing the AST. const identifiers: string[] = [] traverse(ast, { Identifier(path) { const { name } = path.node if (!path.isReferencedIdentifier()) { return } if (Object.hasOwn(es2020, name)) { // Ignore predefined globals. return } identifiers.push(name) }, }) const dependencies = identifiers .filter((ident, idx) => identifiers.indexOf(ident) === idx) // Deduplicate. .filter(isReference) // Filter for cell references. return dependencies}\nThis code uses es2020 from the globals package to ignore global identifiers.\nDealing with assignments\nRecall the complex example from earlier:\nconst sum = (a, b) => Promise.resolve(a + b)let B2{ const B1 = parseInt(B1.value) B2 = await sum(B1, A1)}return `${B2} is the sum of ${B1} and ${A1}.`\nRunning my code on this example returns ["B1", "A1", "B2"]. We’ve mostly solved the problem, but we’re still left with B2, which is bound before its use.\nFortunately, we can use path.scope.hasBinding(name) to figure out if an identifier is bound in the current scope. We can use this to ignore B2:\nif (path.scope.hasBinding(name)) { // Ignore declared variables. return}\nWith this final addition, the output for our example becomes ["B1", "A1"].\nIn practice, it’s probably bad for users to shadow cell references. Shadowing can result in hard-to-debug issues, which is why ESLint has a rule disallowing it. But it’s still good to account for it in our analyzer.\nIt would be redundant to pass globals to the formula unless I’ve modified them in some way. ↩︎\nJavaScript isn’t a regular language, so it cannot be parsed using a regular expression or other pattern-based approaches. ↩︎\nGet more like this in your inboxSubscribe28 May 2023Analyzing dependencies of JavaScript snippetsWhere I befriend Babel to parse out identifiers referenced in code.I’m working on a way to build apps using a spreadsheet-like system called Smoothie.

We will start by understanding the problem and then dive into the details of how Babel can help us solve it.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Problem\\nParsing out the dependencies of a snippet of code is not as simple as splitting it on spaces and collecting the parts that look like identifiers. This approach breaks down on complex code, where variables can be defined in different scopes and contexts.\\n\\nConsider the following example:\\n\\nconst sum = (a, b) => Promise.resolve(a + parseInt(b));\\n\\nThis snippet takes two arguments, a and b, and returns a Promise that resolves to the sum of a and the parsed integer value of b. If we were to use a simple split-and-collect approach, we would only capture the identifiers a and b, but not parseInt or Promise.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we can use Babel to parse the code and extract the dependencies. Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler that can parse and transform JavaScript code. It can also be used as a library to parse and analyze code without transforming it.\\n\\nUsing Babel to Analyze Dependencies\\nTo use Babel to analyze the dependencies of a JavaScript snippet, we need to install the @babel/parser package.

By generating an AST and traversing it, we can extract the dependencies and use them to evaluate the code.\\n\\nAs developers, it's essential to keep up with the latest tools and techniques to improve our workflow and productivity.

Your business doesn’t know how to translate DORA metrics to anything they understand or care about. Cycle Time and Deployment Frequency, for example, show how fast small chunks of work travel through your pipeline and get released to production. That doesn’t help your business because all they care about is how quickly entire features take to get built and released and how many entire new features you can release every month/quarter. Plus, it doesn’t matter how quickly you release work if you aren’t building what the business and customers want.2. DORA metrics are lagging indicators of velocity and stability. In order to actually improve them, there’s an additional set of leading indicator metrics we need to measure and improve like pull request size, review time and code churn.3. Sustained improvement in engineering organizations doesn’t happen without bottom-up change from developers. I was a developer once (not that long ago) and most developers I know aren’t interested in being called into meetings and shown dashboards. Real change comes from optimizing workflows where developers spend all their time - in the IDE and in Slack. To connect the dots between DORA metrics and better business outcomes, we have to stop treating them like the be-all-end-all and look at the bigger picture of engineering improvement.How Do Engineering Teams Deliver Value? Some say engineering teams should measure success based on business outcomes like revenue. It’s a nice idea. But in the real world, it’s pretty hard to connect the dots from engineering directly to profits. And that’s okay because there are two proxies for those business outcomes we can control and measure in engineering.Value Variable 1: Deliver More Features FasterSpeaking as the CEO of a fast growing startup, shipping new features faster is almost always the number one thing I want from engineering. New features help sales close new deals and help customer success secure renewals - both 👏 translate 👏 to revenue 👏.More specifically, there are three things I’m looking for from our engineering leaders:Can we ship incrementally more value with what we already have?Can we ship significantly more value after we invest in new engineers?Are we delivering the features the business asked for? The first two are about speed and predictability. The third is about alignment. Value Variable 2: Deliver on PromisesA really important, highly underrated way engineering organizations provide value is just by following through on what they say they’re going to do. When I was a VP of Engineering, I remember constantly having to change dates and lower expectations in the exec meeting. If we’re constantly apologizing for missing commitments or have lots of bugs & incidents affecting customers - it 👏 hurts 👏 the 👏 business 👏. Want more deep dives like this? Subscribe to get one every Thursday + a new podcast every Tuesday 👇Two Non-DORA Metrics Great for Showing Engineering Outcomes Since the goal is to deliver on promises and deliver more features faster, our process for improvement has to start with our projects. Projects, initiatives, epics, features—whatever you call them at your organization—are the shared language between engineering and business.So, how does the business know we’re meeting our commitments on the projects they care about? It helps to report these two metrics on a regular basis: Money Metric 1: Project Allocation Project Allocation answers the question “what % of our team is working on each of our projects?” CEOs love this metric because it quickly shows if engineering is working on the things the business cares about most. Remember, it doesn’t matter if you’re delivering more features if they’re the wrong ones. You’ll love this metric because it brings logic to negotiations about how much work your team can do. If you get asked to take on a new project, you can point to the project allocation report and say “Absolutely. Which of these existing projects should we invest less in?” And it can give you a rational foundation to ask for more headcount. Money Metric 2: Project Planning Accuracy Project Planning Accuracy answers the question “are we going to hit our promises for this project?” A LinearB Labs research study found that the average sprint planning accuracy across 1,900 teams running Scrum in 2021 was 46% 😲 You’re never going to deliver the features you promised over the course of a quarter if the teams contributing are delivering <half of what they planned every 2-3 weeks.What about Project Velocity? Some teams use this metric to answer the question “are we moving faster or slower on project XYZ?” Be careful. Not all issues and story points are equal and velocity can be abused if not used carefully. Connecting the Dots Between DORA Metrics & Engineering OutcomesOnce you have a baseline for Project Allocation and Planning Accuracy, you can start to improve them. This is where DORA metrics become useful. Cycle Time & OutcomesCycle Time is the measure for how quickly chunks of work flow through your development cycle. Faster cycles mean fewer process bottlenecks and more predictability.This is why low Cycle Time is the number one leading indicator for high Planning Accuracy. More than half of teams surveyed in the LinearB Labs study had a Cycle Time of more than nine days. If those teams are running two-week sprints, that means any work they haven’t started coding by the fifth day of the sprint is likely getting carried over. Deployment Frequency & OutcomesDeployment frequency indicates how often new work gets released into the hands of customers. It’s a critical leading indicator of Planning Accuracy. Low deployment frequency means it takes longer to get new features, usability enhancements and bug fixes into production. Change Failure Rate (CFR), Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) & OutcomesThese two metrics aren't just good proxies for measuring customer experience. Yes, having fewer production incidents and fixing them faster will make customers happy. But, low CFR and MTTR translate to less unplanned work which leads to higher planning accuracy and more time spent on new features. That’s how the DORA 4 help deliver better business outcomes. Now let’s look at how to actually improve your DORA metrics. The 4-step Process to Improve DORA 4 Metrics LinearB partnered with elite engineering organizations from BigID, Drata, GRIN, Bumble, Rapid 7, Appcues, and Nimble to build this process over the last three years. It’s working for them, so it just might work for you 😁Step 1. Benchmark Your PerformanceObviously, to improve your DORA metrics, you need to know where you stand. There are quite a few places you can pull them from:Some issue trackers have ways of calculating Cycle Time and MTTR. Most CI/CD tools calculate Deployment Frequency Lots of observability tools calculate CFR and MTTR You can get all four DORA metrics free-forever from LinearBPRO TIP: Be careful using a single source of data to calculate your metrics. Issue trackers, for example, only provide accurate data if your hygiene is really good. LinearB correlates data from Git, issues, releases and incidents to ensure the integrity of the calculations. Once you know how your teams are performing, it helps to compare your metrics against industry benchmarks. To see how you compare to other engineering organizations, check out the DORA research from 2019 or the LinearB Labs study from Q1 2022. Step 2. Look at the Leading Indicators DORA metrics are leading indicators of planning accuracy and predictability, but they are lagging indicators of efficiency and quality. This means, once you know which DORA metrics you want to improve, there’s another set of metrics you need to learn: Pull Request TimeThis takes up 2/3 of Cycle Time on average so it’s a great place to start. We define Pull Request Time as the combination of PR Pickup Time (how long it takes for a review to start after a PR has been issued) and PR Review Time (how long it takes for a PR to get merged after the review has started). LinearB Labs studied 847,000 pull requests and found that half of all PRs are idle for 50.4% of their lifespan. This means if you have an average Cycle Time of 8 days, your pull requests are sitting idle for 2.5 days on average! Reducing PR Time reduces Cycle Time AND, by removing idle time and increasing situational awareness, it helps reduce CFR and increase quality. Pull Request SizeThis is arguably the most important indicator of a healthy development pipeline. LinearB Labs found that small PRs lead to faster Coding Time, Pickup Time, Review Time, and Deploy Time. Why? Small chunks of work are more likely to be finished without interruptionsSmall PRs are more likely to be picked up fasterSmall PRs have fewer hand-offs and idle timeSmall PRs are easier to merge and release. All this combines to help Cycle Time and Deployment Frequency. Small PRs are also likely to have higher test coverage and more thorough reviews which reduce CFR. And, of course, they’re easier to roll back and fix, which helps MTTR. (Quick note: Apologies to all of the GitLab users out there. I know you call them merge requests 😁)Code Churn Code Churn, sometimes called Rework, highlights the percentage of code you’re re-writing within three weeks of merge. If your code churn is high, you are:Wasting timeProbably seeing a lot of unplanned work.Both slow you down. Churned code is also more likely to have quality issues which increases your CFR. So, how do we actually improve PR Time, PR Size, and Code Churn? It's time to get our developers involved in step 3 👇Step 3. Establish Team Working AgreementsMetrics and dashboards alone don’t improve dev teams. For sustained improvement of DORA metrics and all of the leading indicators from step 2, we need buy-in from our developers. A meeting to establish team working agreements is a good place to start. It looks like this:Goal: 👉 Leave with written team working agreements for improving key areas affecting the leading indicators from step 2. Attendance 👉 Team lead and their immediate team. No VPs, Directors or PMs.Length 👉 You may finish in 15-30 minutes but block 50 minutes to be safe.Format 👉 Team lead runs a safe discussion where everyone gets a chance to talk. Prep 👉 Bring last 90 days of data to the meeting to inform the discussion. QuestionsThe team lead can prepare a few questions based on the data to get things started. Examples include… “What’s the longest a PR should sit?” “Whose job, issuer or reviewer, is it to ensure reviews start on time?”“What’s the ideal PR size for new feature work?”TipsExplain the why behind the meeting, the need for improvement and start with “one-tier improvement.” Meaning, for example, if your average PR Size is currently in the “needs focus” tier, shoot for “fair” versus “strong.” Write everything down and review every 30-90 days to adjust for improvement and what you learn. I promise your developers will actually like this meeting. They want to produce high-quality work, merge faster and get back to solving new problems. All of the things that slow down your Cycle Time and increase your CFR hurt them too. Team Working Agreements give them power over their work, accountability within the team, and help them see how their individual effort connects to business value. Step 4. Optimize Developer Workflow I became a developer because I wanted to build things and solve problems. Except most of us are lucky if we write code 1-2 hours a day. The rest of our time is spent reviewing other people’s code, updating Jira tickets, writing status updates, sorting through Slack noise and attending meetings. These tasks have a negative correlation to PR review time, code churn, DORA metrics and planning accuracy. LinearB Labs found that 31% of work in Git is not connected to a ticket and half of all pull requests sit idle for 50.4% of the time. These are proof points that the developer workflow for non-coding tasks is far from optimized. Git systems have some native alerts built in that help with pull requests, but I’d say we’re in the very early days of building the tools we need to support developers. I believe these tools need to be advanced in three ways:Correlate data from multiple sources e.g. Git, issues, releases, incidentsLive at the “edge” where developers work e.g. IDE, SlackMove beyond alerting to full automation LinearB built a bot specifically for developers called WorkerB. By streamlining repetitive, menial work associated with non-coding tasks, we help developers merge faster and spend more time coding, which leads to improved DORA metrics, higher planning accuracy and better engineering outcomes. Improvement in Action Our philosophy for using leading indicators to improve DORA Metrics is being used by thousands of engineering teams. This improvement ultimately leads to increased planning accuracy, delivering on promises and delivering more features faster. I hope you have the chance to test out our four-step recipe for DORA metric improvement; we spend a lot of time thinking about data-driven engineering at LinearB.

However, many businesses are using them incorrectly, leading to confusion and ineffective use of these metrics. In this article, we will explore what DORA metrics are, how they are used, and how to use them effectively to drive engineering improvement and achieve better business outcomes.\\n\\nDORA Metrics Defined\\nThe DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) group established four metrics to help engineering teams figure out what it looks like to operate as an elite team and how they compare to the industry. These metrics are:\\n\\n1. Deployment Frequency - Measures how often code is deployed to production.\\n2. Cycle Time (sometimes called Lead Time for Changes) - Measures the time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production.\\n3. Change Failure Rate - Measures the percentage of production deployments that result in a failure.\\n4. Mean Time to Restore (sometimes called Time to Restore Service) - Measures the time it takes to restore service after a production failure.\\n\\nAccording to DORA, measuring these values and continuously iterating to improve on them can significantly improve business outcomes.\\n\\nUsing DORA Metrics Effectively\\nMeasuring DORA metrics alone does not lead to improvement or better business outcomes. To use them effectively, businesses need to understand how to translate these metrics into something they understand and care about. Here are some tips on how to use DORA metrics effectively:\\n\\n1. Align Metrics with Business Goals - DORA metrics should align with business goals to drive improvement and better outcomes. For example, if the business goal is to increase revenue, then measuring deployment frequency and cycle time can help achieve this goal by enabling faster delivery of new features and improvements.\\n\\n2. Use Metrics for Continuous Improvement - DORA metrics should be used to identify areas for improvement and continuously iterate to achieve better outcomes. For example, if the change failure rate is high, then the team can focus on improving the quality of code and testing processes to reduce the failure rate.\\n\\n3. Use Metrics to Drive Collaboration - DORA metrics can be used to drive collaboration between teams and departments. For example, if the mean time to restore is high, then the team can collaborate with the operations team to improve the process of restoring service after a production failure.\\n\\nCode Snippet Example:\\nHere is an example of how to use DORA metrics in code:\\n\\n```\\n# Calculate deployment frequency\\ndeployments = get_deployments()\\ndeployment_frequency = len(deployments) / total_time\\n\\n# Calculate cycle time\\ncommits = get_commits()\\ncycle_time = (time_to_production - time_to_commit) / len(commits)\\n\\n# Calculate change failure rate\\ndeployments = get_deployments()\\nfailures = get_failures()\\nchange_failure_rate = failures / len(deployments)\\n\\n# Calculate mean time to restore\\nfailures = get_failures()\\nrestore_time = get_restore_time()\\nmean_time_to_restore = restore_time / len(failures)\\n```\\n\\nConclusion\\nDORA metrics are a powerful tool to drive engineering improvement and achieve better business outcomes. However, businesses need to use them effectively by aligning them with business goals, using them for continuous improvement, and driving collaboration between teams and departments. By using DORA metrics effectively, businesses can achieve significant improvements in their software development processes and outcomes."}
6	Building startup with AI cofounder (day 21): building an MVP using GraphQL	https://knowlo.co/blog/day-21-building-an-mvp-signup-flow-and-graphql/	published	reddit	Day 21: Building an MVP – signup flow and GraphQLCofounderGPT and I got stuck on Day 19 with AppSync JavaScript resolvers. Everything worked great until we tried to deploy the app and realized that JavaScript resolvers do not work for unit resolvers! Currently, they only support pipeline resolvers.Resolving the resolvers issueAs mentioned in the previous article, besides JavaScript resolvers, we have the following options: VTL resolvers and Lambda functions.VTL resolvers are hard to write and even harder to test. I have some experience with them, and CofounderGPT can probably help. But using VTL is the opposite of fun, so I don’t want to use them unless I have to.On the other side, writing a Lambda function is not hard. However, using a Lambda function to read or write some simple values in the DynamoDB table is overkill. Lambda functions require a bit more code, have a scaling limit (that can be increased, and are also slightly slower than VTL and JavaScript resolvers (because of their initialization or cold start).So, do we have any other options?We do! And it’s a bit crazy, but it should work perfectly fine for our scenario. What if we wrap unit resolvers in a pipeline resolver?Let’s pause here and try to explain unit vs. pipeline resolvers first.Each GraphQL query and mutation require a resolver. Resolver is a function that is a glue between GraphQL API and the rest of the world (data sources). GraphQL does not care about resolver complexity. These functions can do whatever they want if they return the data in an expected format. AWS AppSync has two global types of resolvers: you can write a Lambda function and do whatever you want, or you can write a resolver with VTL and now JavaScript, where you have certain limitations, but you get lower latency, less code, and faster scaling in return.With VTL and JavaScript resolvers, one resolver can only talk to one data source and run a single supported operation. For example, you can read from one DynamoDB table or send one HTTP request. These resolvers are called unit resolvers.If you need to read the data from multiple data sources, you can chain VTL or JavaScript resolvers in a pipeline resolver. Each pipeline resolver has a before template (prepares the request data for units), an after template (packs the response in the response), and a series of functions (each is similar to a unit resolver, with some minor API differences).Because JavaScript resolvers support only pipeline resolvers, we can make a pipeline resolver wrapper for a single function (or unit resolver). The downside of this approach is slightly increased complexity and a slightly slower GraphQL operation (I can guess this because I never measured it, but it’s probably up to 50ms slower). But the upside is that we can still use TypeScript instead of VTL for resolvers. And trust me, that’s a huge benefit!This approach sounds like a hack, and it is a hack, but it seems that we are not the only ones with the same idea! Multiple articles on the internet write about the same approach. For example, the “Hitting the road with AppSync JavaScript resolvers” article uses a CDK construct to “hide” this complexity. This approach makes even more sense when we know that AWS AppSync plans to support unit resolvers in the future. In this case, once the AWS AppSync team releases JavaScrip unit resolver support, we can simply change one part of our code, and all of our resolvers will become unit resolvers!We’ll do the same: I created a new folder in the “lib” folder of the backend project and named it “stack” (I know, I am “very” creative). And then, I created a new file inside with the name “javascript-resolver.ts” (the full path is “backend/lib/stack/javascript-resolver.ts”) and the following content:CofounderGPT is much better at explaining code snippets than I am, so he’s its explanation:And that’s it. We can now use our new construct instead of graphQLApi.createResolver in the main Knowlo CDK stack file. Here’s the new code for our resolver:If we run the npm run cdk deploy -- --parameters LogLevel=DEBUG command to redeploy our stack, everything works fine now. The problem is successfully resolved.Can CofounderGPT generate resolvers?Can I ask CofounderGPT to generate resolvers? AWS AppSync released JavaScript resolvers after the ChatGPT training cutoff point, but we might be able to “teach” CofounderGPT the JavaScript resolver syntax. Let’s try! I used the browsing plugin for the following prompt.Slobodan: Here’s the documentation for AWS AppSync JavaScript resolvers for DynamoDB data source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.html. Can you help me writing JavaScript resolvers in TypeScript for my GraphQL query if I provide the GraphQL schema and the DynamoDB database design?CofounderGPT: Sure, I’d be happy to help you with that. Please provide the details of your GraphQL schema and the DynamoDB database design so I can understand your requirements better and assist you in writing the TypeScript resolvers for AWS AppSync.This was a new conversation, so I sent a GraphQL schema and a DynamoDB table design to CofounderGPT and reminded it that we store all the data in a single table.Slobodan: Can you generate an AppSync JavaScript resolver for the `createProject` mutation? Remember, I need a TypeScript version. And you can access the AppSync JavaScript resolvers documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.html.CofounderGPT: Sure, I can help you create a TypeScript version of the AppSync JavaScript resolver for the createProject mutation. Here’s how you might do it based on the provided GraphQL schema and DynamoDB single-table design:This resolver function begins by destructuring the input argument from the context. It then generates an id for the new project using the context.util.autoId() function and the current timestamp with context.util.time.nowISO().Next, it creates a project object that includes all the required attributes for a project, including the id, the knowledge base provider, the knowledge base S3 path, the description, the creation timestamp, and an archived status that is initially set to false.Finally, the function returns a PutItem operation request for DynamoDB, with the key being a combination of the generated id for the project and the attribute values being all the properties of the project object.The context.util.dynamodb.toMapValues function is used to convert the JavaScript objects into a format that DynamoDB can store.Please note that this is a very basic resolver function. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to add more complex logic, such as error handling, additional attribute validation, or further manipulation of the data before it is stored in DynamoDB​1​.Slobodan: Excellent! I also need a response function in the same file. See the documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-reference-overview-js.html.CofounderGPT: Based on the provided AWS AppSync documentation, the response handler for your createProject mutation would look like this in TypeScript:This function takes the context object ctx as a parameter and simply returns the result of the mutation operation. The ctx.result object contains the data returned from the DynamoDB operation, which will be the newly created project in this case.This function will be called by AppSync after the request handler function has completed, and its returned value will be used as the response data for the createProject mutation. Since the mutation is expected to return a Project type, the data returned by this function should align with the fields defined in the Project type in your GraphQL schema.It’s worth noting that this function is quite simple and just returns the result of the mutation operation as is. In a more complex application, you might want to perform additional processing in the response handler function, such as transforming the data, performing additional error handling, or implementing custom logic based on the result of the mutation operation​1​.Slobodan: Ok, not bad. But here’s an example for the response function. Can we do something similar to this?CofounderGPT: The example you provided is a more complex response function that performs additional processing on the result of the DynamoDB operation before returning it. Here’s the equivalent function in TypeScript:In this function:This is a common pattern for response functions in AppSync resolvers, where you might want to transform the data returned from DynamoDB and handle any errors that occurred during the operation.Slobodan: You can find more about PutItem API here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_PutItem.html Can you return only the result without version?CofounderGPT: Based on the AWS documentation, the PutItem operation in DynamoDB creates a new item or replaces an old item with a new item (including all the attributes). However, the PutItem operation itself does not return any data in the response. It does not include the item’s details that have been written to the table​1​.As for AWS AppSync, when a PutItem operation is performed through an AppSync resolver, the data that is written to DynamoDB is automatically converted to GraphQL and JSON primitive types, and is made available in the context result (context.result)​3​.In your provided example response function, it seems like you are trying to remove the version from the result before returning it. This would work if the PutItem operation actually returned the item data. However, as per the DynamoDB documentation, this is not the case. Therefore, you wouldn’t have a version attribute or any other attribute of the item in ctx.result after a PutItem operation.To achieve what you want (i.e., to get the item without the version after a PutItem operation), you would need to perform a separate GetItem operation after PutItem, and then you can modify the returned item as needed before returning it in your response function.Please let me know if you have any more questions or if there’s something else you’d like me to do!Everything CofounderGPT generated and said makes sense. But I need to test it to be sure. However, to test GraphQL queries, I need to go a step back and finish the signup and login process in the frontend app.Signup and loginI did a few things in a frontend application to enable the signup and login flow. A step-by-step explanation would take a lot of space here, so I’ll walk you through the most important parts. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter or Linkedin if you have any questions.At the end, the frontend folder structure looked like this:One of the essential things that I changed is the router in the App.tsx file. It has the following code now:In this code:The AppShell component looks like this:CofounderGPT’s explanation:A few notes:The signup process has two steps: a signup form and a confirmation step (a code is sent via email). This flow is defined in the Signup component. Here’s the code for that component:In this code snippet:This code provides a secure signup process for a user, including validation to ensure that the information entered is correct and a second step to verify the user. It also handles errors and some edge cases, like needing to resend the validation code. There’s still some work here to make it production-ready, but it’s good enough to test the GraphQL part.The signup page looks similar to the following screenshot:Once a user enters the data, the app will send a verification code via email and present the following screen:Once the account is verified, a user is automatically logged in. The dashboard still looks the same (the content is hidden because it’s not connected to GraphQL yet):Finally, the log in screen looks like the following screenshot:These pages give us enough to test and connect GraphQL requests, which we’ll do in the next step of the MVP-building process.ScoreboardSince I don’t trust Google to charge my card automatically for ads because I’ve seen them abuse this power many times in Vacation Tracker.

We also used GraphQL queries to fetch user data and display it on the frontend.\\n\\nOverall, using GraphQL for our MVP has been a great choice. It has allowed us to easily handle complex data operations and has provided a flexible and scalable architecture for our application. We look forward to continuing our journey with GraphQL and building a successful startup with our AI cofounder.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by wrapping unit resolvers in a pipeline resolver, we were able to overcome the limitations of JavaScript resolvers and avoid the complexity of VTL resolvers and Lambda functions. We also used GraphQL mutations and queries to handle user registration and authentication for our MVP. As developers, it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools, and GraphQL is definitely a technology worth exploring."}

25	SVG versus Canvas: Which technology to choose and why?	https://www.jointjs.com/blog/svg-versus-canvas	published	reddit	SVG versus Canvas: Choosing the right technology for your web applicationSetting the sceneChoosing what technology to use can often be a time consuming process. A dilemma can often arise if you are unsure of the benefits or drawbacks of each prospective choice. This is understandable as the last thing you want is to choose a particular technology, and later realize you should have gone with a different option for one reason or another.Debates about SVG versus Canvas are no different. A quick search on the topic will return a multitude of articles, and stackoverflow questions comparing the two technologies. It can be a daunting task to piece together all of the information in the hope of making a decision you can be confident in.In the following article, we will cover some of the same topics you have probably read about elsewhere, but hope to provide you with a more nuanced view. We will also shed some light on what implications those topics have for developers and business owners in practical terms.Before getting into the weeds of the debate, in an article titled SVG versus Canvas, it would be remiss not to at least mention some of the basic differences between the two technologies at the outset, so let’s get to it!Vectors and PixelsTwo households, both alike in creating visual content for the web, but fundamentally different in their approach. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML based markup language used to describe 2D vector graphics. Canvas, on the other hand, allows users to draw on the HTML Canvas element via a JavaScript API.Canvas code example:-- CODE language-svg --<canvas id="canvas"></canvas><script>const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");ctx.fillStyle = "green";ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);</script>‍SVG code example:-- CODE language-svg --<svg> <rect width="150" height="100" fill="green" /></svg>From the beginning, SVG was developed as an open standard by W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium), that means it was designed specifically to work well with other web standards. Generally, you can think of SVG as declarative drawing instructions that can be added alongside your HTML.The history of Canvas is a little more muddled. Originally introduced by Apple, it was later standardized by WHATWG (the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). As Canvas was originally created as a proprietary element by Apple, its adherence to web standards is questionable, and still lacking in important areas to this day.The most pertinent difference is how each technology presents its content. Canvas is raster based, meaning it’s arrays of pixels arranged on a grid, while SVG is vector based, meaning it uses mathematical metadata when describing a graphic. The advantage of the latter is that when zooming or scaling, SVG will maintain its integrity, remaining crisp and clean on different-sized monitors and resolutions. Canvas content, including text, doesn’t preserve clarity when resized.A second, and at first glance, seemingly less important difference is that each SVG element is present in the DOM (Document Object Model), while Canvas is represented as a sole element. The reason why this is relevant will become more apparent later.Now that we have established that both technologies can draw stuff, let’s dig a little deeper on some important aspects to consider when making decisions about SVG and Canvas.Accessibility: What happens in Canvas, stays in CanvasA blazingly fast ™ website with incredible content is all for nothing if it’s not accessible to its users. The same idea can be applied to creating information-rich visual graphics, and the technology you choose to create those graphics can play an integral role in determining just how accessible they are.If you want to talk about people with disabilities, they represent 16% of the global population according to the World Health Organization. While all of those people obviously don’t use assistive software to navigate the web, the number is difficult to ignore if you are a business owner who wants to broaden their user base, or if you are worried about the huge influx of lawsuits regarding the inaccessible web in recent years. Not only is accessibility a good business practice, but it’s the right thing to do in order to create the best experience for everybody.In light of this, how do SVG and Canvas stack up against each other in terms of accessibility? Earlier, we mentioned that Canvas is a single element within the DOM. To put it frankly, this has huge repercussions for accessibility. Canvas doesn’t provide any information about the drawn content, nor does it expose any information to accessibility tools. MDN puts it rather bluntly:“In general, you should avoid using canvas in an accessible website or app.”In contrast, as SVG and all its content is in the DOM, it naturally conveys semantic meaning, and assistive technology can access sub-elements, text and links. As SVG was designed with web standards in mind, it can be further enhanced by accessibility standards such as ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications). That means what is visually represented in a graphic, can also be conveyed in the markup itself, allowing assistive software to get access to this information.Is it possible to convey HTML Canvas content as markup? This is actually an important question in terms of Canvas and accessibility. The short answer is … it depends. Does your Canvas display some simple static shapes, or does it contain a complex interactive diagram? W3C (The World Wide Web Consortium), the primary web standards organization, says the following:“When authors use the canvas element, they must also provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially the same function or purpose as the canvas's bitmap. This content may be placed as content of the canvas element. The contents of the canvas element, if any, are the element's fallback content.”Fallback content in the form of a text description can certainly convey the characteristics of a simple static shape. When it comes to a dynamic diagram, providing fallback content that conveys the same function becomes a little more troublesome. In fact, the HTML specification says best practice is to include focusable elements as fallback content corresponding to each focusable part of the Canvas. At this point, you might be asking yourself, why not just use SVG in the first place?Canvas is often sold as “not having to deal with the overhead of the DOM”. In terms of accessibility, that “overhead” is your users.Performance, a bird’s eye viewIn a large proportion of articles and stackoverflow answers, performance is the main reason provided for choosing Canvas over SVG. The topic is often reduced to a one-liner such as “If you want to render 10,000 elements, use Canvas!”. What more do you need to know, right?An incorrect assertion that you may also come across in these discussions is that Canvas always outperforms SVG, but that’s not necessarily the case. SVG is actually more performant with a small number of objects, or over a large surface area. If you work with a small surface area, or a large number of objects, Canvas is out in front.Other points that could be relevant are the type of content and the manner in which users will interact with your application, or if anything can be done to alleviate the performance advantage that Canvas has in some use cases.Consider a scatter plot with 10,000 data points. Generally, this type of chart provides an overview of some dataset by plotting 2 variables, and suggests some correlation between them. The important information is gleaned from looking at the points as a whole, not at each one individually.In terms of UI (User Interface), you can assume the user doesn’t need to zoom in on each point, or that each circle would have child elements such as text or images. If you wanted to introduce a timeline to animate each point over time, you can certainly start reaching for Canvas as your tool of choice.The type of information you need to visualize more often than not determines the manner in which it’s displayed. What if each data point needs to be an interactive card-like element with text, images, and action buttons? How will your users interact with this content?Apart from it being less likely to have 10,000 data points you need to visualize in this manner, how important would it be to view all these elements as a whole? In this instance, the detail of each individual element is probably what users are most interested in, and the amount of these elements that could be viewed simultaneously in a useful way is certainly limited.This begs the question, is there any strategy that could be employed to improve performance? On the remote chance that someone needed to view 10,000 information-rich elements as a whole, can a simple view of each element be rendered instead? After all, the element details wouldn’t be legible anyway. What about rendering only a subset of elements at a given time? In the age of “lazy loading”, a good use case would be to only render visible elements within the viewport, saving valuable milliseconds.In fact some libraries, including JointJS, provide similar solutions already. JointJS can avoid rendering content which is not visible to the user. When deciding which technology to use, it may be worth your time asking similar questions. If the primary advantage of Canvas is somewhat diminished, are you willing to sacrifice all of the other benefits SVG provides?More meaningful testing with SVGEnsuring your application behaves as expected is an integral part of the development process. In order to ascertain that your graphic functions correctly, debugging problems and testing functionality will be ingrained in your workflow. Once again, when comparing Canvas and SVG, it’s difficult not to return to the fact that Canvas is a solitary HTML element in the DOM. This has numerous practical implications which may affect the speed or reliability of delivering your software.Naturally, one of the first resources a developer will use when presented with a visual bug is to inspect an element in the DOM with developer tools. It’s a familiar process that can reveal a lot of crucial information quickly, such as if the element is even present in the DOM in the first place, or if it has the expected characteristics, and so on. This all contributes to identifying problems swiftly, and addressing them as needed.As a lone Canvas element acts on the principle of what you see is what you get, developers are deprived of this point of contact with their applications, and will often have to pore over longer Canvas code to find an issue, losing valuable time in doing so.In order to minimize the amount of debugging you have to do, you’ll probably want to introduce testing in your workflows. Since SVG and Canvas are both used to create graphics, it’s usually imperative that you test the UI (User Interface) of your applications. Some of the popular E2E (end-to-end) testing frameworks that are used to automate this process are Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium.One thing these frameworks have in common is that they work under the assumption that DOM elements are accessible. Elements are located via the concept of “Selectors”, a catch-all term that can include CSS selectors, accessibility roles, or even text. The fact that none of this information is readily available when using Canvas should immediately raise alarm bells.If attempting to do E2E testing with Canvas, you’ll first likely have to write lots of custom code to locate the Canvas “elements”, then have to capture events on the Canvas element itself, or use some workaround to pretend to interact with elements without actually generating any DOM events.The goal of E2E testing is to test applications from a real user’s perspective. Any makeshift solution that could be implemented with the aim of emulating this process for Canvas will simply never be a convincing substitute. The bottom line is, if you want to do authentic end-to-end testing of your UI, SVG is the way to go.What the heck is Foreign Object?It might seem strange to focus on a specific SVG element as an advantageous reason for choosing SVG, but it’s not without merit. If a requirement for your graphic is to have interactive elements, developers are generally a habitual bunch. They will often reach for technologies they are familiar with, and in web land, the dominant force in this regard is still good old HTML.‍Foreign Object essentially allows the addition of HTML in your SVG elements. Embedding HTML text, creating basic interactive elements like buttons, or working with HTML inputs is all made a straightforward process. If you want to work with HTML on Canvas, a more unconventional approach such as rendering HTML on top of an underlying element will have to be adopted.While this technique can be successful, it comes with a lot of additional complexity, such as the need to keep dimensions and position of the HTML in sync with the element itself. Taking advantage of foreign object in SVG allows you to create HTML-rich elements while avoiding some of the difficulties of other approaches.Don’t believe us? Learn more about foreign object in SVG in our JointJS tutorial, and see what you can create.CSS and SVG play nicelyCSS is, and will remain one of the main pillars of the modern web. The ability to introduce uniform changes via CSS results in more maintainable applications. As SVG and CSS play nicely together, all of that CSS goodness extends to your SVG, allowing for even more modular code.This integration is so seamless, it’s often overlooked just how easy it is to update some SVG styles using CSS pseudo-classes, such as :hover. A painful amount of code has to be written in order to achieve similar functionality with Canvas.Need to get creative with some more vibrant interactions? Animation is now ubiquitous online, and CSS allows the implementation of complex animations with relative ease, often outperforming any JavaScript equivalents. These animation techniques can be utilized with all DOM elements, including SVG.CSS is not a static technology either. The evolution of CSS also means that your SVG code can evolve alongside it, benefiting from new standards and functionality, often adopted from CSS preprocessors. Component based architecture is ever present in the web world. With great new features like native CSS nesting, this architecture will be a mainstay for years to come, allowing for even more organization within SVG applications. As you can see, when evaluating a debate about Canvas versus SVG, those two technologies by themselves don’t paint the whole picture.Bits and BobsNot all facets of a debate about SVG and Canvas need to remain within the realm of the development world, there are also some external aspects which may be worth considering when choosing a technology, such as team structure, or how your content is viewed by search engines.Teams usually consist of many roles, each member has their own strengths and type of work they focus on. Developers are often not the strongest designers, and as a result many teams will include both. The path to creating beautiful looking software, usually begins at the feet of designers. If you are lucky enough to have designers at your disposal, that means a lot of work can be entrusted to them, freeing up developers to focus on what they do best.Need a beautiful set of icons for your startup idea? If working with SVG, this entire process can be taken care of by your design team without a lot of input from developers. Modern design tools like Figma or Adobe illustrator allow the export of SVG, so an icon set can be passed to your development team upon completion, and embedded in your application with relative ease. As SVG is just markup, developers can update any other SVG properties as needed without any back and forth. As images for Canvas will always be static, extra coordination among team members is needed to ensure all image properties are in order before handing them over. Not to mention that you’ll need a little extra JavaScript to add the images to Canvas.SEO (Search Engine Optimization) isn’t the first thing that pops into one’s mind when comparing Canvas and SVG, but it can certainly be beneficial to your business. SVG and Canvas both excel at complex graphics, but only one of them will be searchable and indexable. At a basic level, when users are presented with a large amount of text, it’s possible even for most novices to utilize a command/ctrl + F command on their keyboard in order to find some relevant text. This simply isn’t possible with Canvas. A nice side effect of the DOM is that the text in SVG will also be indexable. Presenting crucial information in graphic form could be incredibly desirable depending on the use case. Using search engines like Google, your users will be able to discover text content through your graphics when using SVG.Last thoughts on SVGSVG and Canvas are both established technologies, so whichever one you choose, you will be supported by huge ecosystems and communities. Based on the points raised in this article, it won’t surprise you to find that our preferred tool of choice is SVG, but Canvas certainly has its use cases too. In our opinion, the practical and ethical benefits of SVG far outweigh what Canvas has to offer, and if the performance benefit of Canvas can be mitigated with techniques such as virtual rendering, the question remains if you are willing to leave all of the advantages that SVG has to offer on the table? Lastly, if some milliseconds will make or break your application, it may be worth your time taking a look at the WebGL/WebGPU APIs instead of the Canvas API.AuthorsRead nextDemo Wednesday: Isometric diagrams with SVGDemo Wednesday: Searchable SitemapDemo Wednesday: JointJS+ ChatGPT MindMapSpeed up your development with a powerful library	2023-06-07	{"title":"\\"SVG versus Canvas: A Comprehensive Guide for Web Developers\\"","article":"\\nThis article was originally published on [insert website name and link]. \\n\\nChoosing the right technology for your web application can be a daunting task. With so many options available, it's important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of each prospective choice. When it comes to the debate of SVG versus Canvas, the decision can be particularly challenging. \\n\\nIn this comprehensive guide, we'll provide you with a more nuanced view of the debate and explain what implications those topics have for developers and business owners in practical terms. \\n\\nFirst, let's briefly cover the basic differences between SVG and Canvas. SVG is a vector-based technology that uses mathematical equations to create images. This means that SVG images are scalable and can be resized without losing quality. On the other hand, Canvas is a pixel-based technology that uses a grid of pixels to create images. This means that Canvas images are not as scalable as SVG images and can appear pixelated when resized. \\n\\nSo, which technology should you choose? The answer depends on the specific needs of your web application. If your application requires highly detailed and scalable graphics, SVG is the way to go. However, if your application requires more dynamic and interactive graphics, Canvas may be the better choice. \\n\\nOne of the key advantages of SVG is its ability to create complex graphics that can be easily manipulated with CSS and JavaScript. For example, you can use CSS to change the color of an SVG image or JavaScript to animate it. This makes SVG a popular choice for creating data visualizations and interactive graphics. \\n\\nCanvas, on the other hand, is better suited for creating real-time graphics and animations. Because Canvas is pixel-based, it can handle large amounts of data and render graphics quickly. This makes it a popular choice for creating games and other interactive applications that require fast rendering times. \\n\\nAnother factor to consider when choosing between SVG and Canvas is browser support. While both technologies are widely supported by modern browsers, SVG has better support for older browsers. This is because SVG has been around longer than Canvas and has had more time to gain widespread adoption. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the choice between SVG and Canvas ultimately comes down to the specific needs of your web application. If you require highly detailed and scalable graphics, SVG is the way to go. If you require more dynamic and interactive graphics, Canvas may be the better choice. Regardless of which technology you choose, it's important to keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses of each and how they can impact the performance and functionality of your web application. \\n\\nTo help you get started with SVG and Canvas, here are some code snippets that demonstrate their capabilities:\\n\\nSVG example:\\n\\n```html\\n<svg width=\\"100\\" height=\\"100\\">\\n  <circle cx=\\"50\\" cy=\\"50\\" r=\\"40\\" stroke=\\"green\\" stroke-width=\\"4\\" fill=\\"yellow\\" />\\n</svg>\\n```\\n\\nCanvas example:\\n\\n```html\\n<canvas id=\\"myCanvas\\" width=\\"200\\" height=\\"100\\"></canvas>\\n<script>\\n  var canvas = document.getElementById(\\"myCanvas\\");\\n  var ctx = canvas.getContext(\\"2d\\");\\n  ctx.fillStyle = \\"red\\";\\n  ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nWe hope this guide has provided you with a better understanding of the SVG versus Canvas debate and how to choose the right technology for your web application. Happy coding!"}

It is so common, and so widespread, that misinformation will find you even if all\nyou view online is cooking recipes, cute puppies, and Irish dancing videos. Therefore, to\ncombat the misinformation, we have all developed robust BS detectors to filter out the crap.\nHowever, regrettably, our BS detectors often have bugs, and I know personally I still have\nto catch myself every now and then.Unfortunately, it is unlikely that misinformation is going anywhere any time soon, even with AI to help. Therefore,\nin order to maintain public health, uphold the integrity of our political systems, and prevent radicalism, we must\nresearch how misinformation spreads and how we can combat it. This is a really hard problem.Thankfully, our group of 3rd and 4th-year university students weren’t tasked with fighting misinformation, but\ninstead we were tasked with developing a tool that the experts can use to research how to fight misinformation.\nWith this goal in mind, we set out on our quest to develop The Misinformation Game! So… what is it? # The Misinformation Game is a free and open-source social-media simulator\nto help run controlled social-media experiments. In short, it lets researchers set up social-media feeds where they made all\nthe posts, so that they can observe how participants interact with them. If you’d like to try it out, we have a\nlive demo that you can try!The development of this project involved making one tech decision in particular that is quite unorthodox. Therefore,\nI thought it would be interesting to write this article to explore that decision, and how it went! The Stack 🥞 # The Misinformation Game was built using Firebase, Tailwind, React, and Google Sheets (yes, you read that right!).\nThe first three, Firebase, Tailwind, and React, are all pretty standard choices. They have a free tier, are quick,\nand are good for UI, respectively.However, if you’re a software engineer reading through this post, your eyebrows might have just hit the ceiling\nat the mention of choosing to put spreadsheets in a tech stack. Stories from my friends and lecturers who’ve had\nthe, ahem, pleasure of wrestling with Excel databases or yanking companies out of the suffocating clutches of Excel sheets,\nmake the nightmares that spreadsheets can cause pretty clear.But, let me just say, I think using Google Sheets for this project was one of the best tech choices we made. Google Sheets, huh, yeah. What is it good for? # Absolutely everything!Well, not everything. Actually, configuration!All configuration for studies in the Misinformation Game is done in big spreadsheets on Google Sheets.\nThese spreadsheets may then be downloaded from Google Sheets and uploaded to The Misinformation Game\nfor presentation to research participants.Maybe, but let me tell you about all of Google Sheets’ quirks and features!UX for Free. Researchers understand spreadsheets! The user experience of navigating and entering information\ninto a spreadsheet is familiar territory. To me, this is the biggest advantage, as we didn’t have to worry about\nnearly as many user-experience headaches when building our backend user interface.Spreadsheets can be Shared. It is now common in many fields for researchers to share the source code of\ntheir projects to aid in reproducing results. This is great! However, for tools that require complex\nconfiguration, this can still be difficult to achieve and is often not possible. Our use of spreadsheets is\none example that does allow the sharing of complex configurations, as all the configuration can be shared\nas a single file. Google Sheets for All Configuration! 🌈 # So you’re saying, we can just use spreadsheets instead of configuration files or bespoke configuration user interfaces!Nope! No. No no no!Whilst spreadsheets were great for our project, they’re definitely not all sunshine and rainbows! 🌈 They have several\nsignificant drawbacks. The Downsides 😬 # Google Sheets may have reduced the time required to develop our tool, but it has also led to significant maintenance\nand update overheads. So, while our tool is more feature-rich and robust thanks to Google Sheets, keeping it that\nway may be difficult.Google Sheets will Change. Our documentation is all based upon a snapshot of Google Sheets at one point in time.\nIt is very likely that Google Sheets will change in the future, and with those changes, our documentation will become\noutdated. This is acceptable for a research tool that may not live for more than a few years, but it is definitely\nundesirable for larger commerical pieces of software.We can’t update people’s configurations in-place. If we make changes to our spreadsheet template,\nusers must manually copy their configuration to the new template. This makes small updates to the configuration\nspreadsheet much more costly, and it destroys any thought of live updates and bugfixes for the configuration.We can’t add our own bespoke features. There are several features, such as live previews, that are simply not\npossible when using this configuration system. While we use spreadsheets, there will always be friction when users must\ndownload their spreadsheets to upload them into the Misinformation Game, where we can provide those features. The Wise Man’s Use of Spreadsheets 🦉 # Sure, spreadsheets have their fare share of hurdles. We don’t control the hosting of Google Sheets,\nit’s difficult to update people’s configurations, and it makes it hard for us to add bespoke features.But guess what? Sometimes the path that gets a few side-eyes and raised brows is the one that gives\nyou the edge. Google Sheets, for all its quirks, allowed us to make our project more feature-rich\nand robust under the limited time and budget that we had available.And let’s face it, in a world where misinformation is as easy to spread as a cute puppy video, we need all the help we can get.\nAnd if that help comes in the form of a spreadsheet… well, bring it on. Final Thoughts # So, there you have it, folks. I probably won’t be using Google Sheets for any future projects any time soon,\nbut I’m sure glad we had it in the arsenal for this one. If you’re interested to learn more about the Misinformation\nGame, we have written extensive documentation for it on this very website (it’s more serious than this post,\nI promise). We also have a preprint paper available on PsyArXiv, and hopefully the\nfull peer-reviewed version will be available soon.This is the first software article that I’ve written, but I hope to write more. If you’d like to find out about\nthose when I do, you can find me (Padraig Lamont) on Twitter or\nMastodon!	2023-06-08	{"title":"Google Sheets: An Unlikely Hero for Configuring Research Tools","article":"\\nGoogle Sheets may not be the first tool that comes to mind when thinking about research tools, but it can be a powerful ally in the fight against misinformation.

Currently, it only supports golang code generation for PostgreSQL databases. We plan to release support for TypeScript code generation along with MySQL and SQLite databases.\nEnglish | 中文\nQueryx is schema-first and type-safe ORM with code generation.\nSchema First: Define application models in a queryx schema file, and it can automatically synchronize with the database structure.\nType Safe: Queryx generates friendly and type-safe ORM methods based on the schema, which come with autocomplete support and are free from type-related errors.\nThis project is heavily inspired by Active Record and ent. Database schema management is built upon Atlas.\nGetting Started\nInstallation\nTo easily install the latest version of queryx, open your terminal and run the following command:\ncurl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiftcarrot/queryx/main/install.sh | sh\nYou can also build queryx from the source following the instructions here.\nAfter installation, run the following command to validate queryx:\nqueryx version\nThis command will output current installed queryx version if installed successfully.\nDefine your first schema\nQueryx uses HCL format for schema defintion. Create the following sample schema.hcl in the current directory:\ndatabase "db" { adapter = "postgresql" config "development" { url = "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/blog_development?sslmode=disable" } generator "client-golang" {} model "Post" { column "title" { type = string } column "content" { type = text } }\n}\nIn this sample schema, we create a queryx database db, which consists of a model Post. Post model contains two fields, title as string type and content as text type. string and text are both predefined queryx types. The db database is defined as the postgresql adapter and the connection config url to the PostgreSQL database is defined through the config block.\nRun the following command to automatically format the schema file:\nqueryx format\nDatabase managment\nRun the following command to create the PostgreSQL database, by default, queryx with read from the development config block. It can be changed by setting the QUERYX_ENV environment variable.\nqueryx db:create\nwhich works the same as\nQUERYX_ENV=development queryx db:create\nOnce the database is created, queryx can automatically migrate the database to the schema defined in schema.hcl:\nqueryx db:migrate\nThe db:migrate command will initially compare the current state of database to the schema defined in schema.hcl. It will generate migrations files in SQL format in the db/migrations directory if there are any differences. It will proceed to execute the generated migration files to update the database in line with the schema defined in schema.hcl.\nCode generation\nIn the sample schema.hcl, we already defined the generator as\ngenerator "client-golang"\nTo generate Golang client methods, simply execute the following command:\nqueryx generate\nQueryx will generate Golang codes in db directory based on the database name. We will cover the basics of CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) using the queryx generated code. For a more detailed breakdown of the generated methods, please refer to the ORM API section.\nTo begin, we instantiate a client object, which serves as the entry point for all interactions with the database.\nc, err := db.NewClient()\nQueryx supports changing database data (insert, update and delete) through a change object. For each model defined in the schema, queryx generates a corresponding change object with setting methods for each field in the model. This ensures the correctness of query and makes it easy to modify data in the database safely.\nCreate a new post:\nnewPost := c.ChangePost().SetTitle("post title").SetContent("post content")\npost, err := c.QueryPost().Create(newPost)\nQueryx also supports the Active Record pattern, which allows Update() or Delete() call on the returned queryx record.\nUpdate the post:\nerr := post.Update(c.ChangePost().SetTitle("new post title"))\nDelete the post:\nerr := post.Delete()\nQueryx also supports update and delete by query.\nUpdate all posts by title:\nupdated, err := c.QueryPost().Where(c.PostTitle.EQ("post title")).UpdateAll(c.ChangePost().SetTitle("new post title"))\nDelete all posts by title:\ndeleted, err := c.QueryPost().Where(c.PostTitle.EQ("post title")).DeleteAll()\nTo retrieve data from the database in Queryx using the primary key:\npost, err := c.QueryPost().Find(1)\nRetrieve all posts by title:\nposts, err := c.QueryPost().Where(c.PostTitle.EQ("post title")).All()\nRetrieve the first post from query:\npost, err := c.QueryPost().Where(c.PostTitle.EQ("post title")).First()\nAssociation\nQueryx supports association definition in the schema file.

For example, a User model will have a table named users. However, you can customize this behavior using the table_name attribute in model block. For example:\nmodel "User" { table_name = "queryx_users"\n}\nIn this example, queryx will generate the table queryx_users for the User model.\nCustom primary key\nBy default, each model defined in the schema will generate an auto-incremented integer id column in the corresponding table. This behavior can be customized using the primary_key block.\nmodel "Code" { default_primary_key = false column "type" { type = string null = false } column "key" { type = string null = false } primary_key { columns = ["type", "key"] }\n}\nIn the example, the Code model, which corrsponds to the codes table, will have a primary key of type and key. It is important to note that customizing primary key will affect generated methods, including Find and Delete. The Find method in generated code for the Code example will no longer accepts an integer but two strings:\nfunc (q *CodeQuery) Find(typ string, key string) (*Code, error)\nUUID primary key is common in many application, to support it in queryx:\nmodel "Device" { default_primary_key = false column "id" { type = uuid null = false } primary_key { columns = ["id"] }\n}\nCLI\nBy default, the queryx cli will read from schema.hcl in the current directory. To use an alternative schema file, you can specify the file path using the --schema flag:\nqueryx format --schema db.hcl\nAll available commands:\nqueryx db:create: create the database\nqueryx db:drop: drop the database\nqueryx db:migrate: generate migration files and run pending migrations\nqueryx db:migrate:generate: generate migration files\nqueryx db:migrate:status: list status of each migration\nqueryx db:rollback: rollback database\nqueryx db:version: print database migration version\nqueryx format: format schema file with HCL formatter\nqueryx generate: generate code based on schema\nqueryx version: print current installed queryx version\nLicense\nQueryx is licensed under Apache 2.0 as found in the LICENSE file.

It allows developers to define their database schema in Rust code and then generate type-safe Rust structs and functions to interact with the database.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of QueryX is its focus on type safety. By defining the database schema in Rust code, developers can catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This can save a lot of time and effort in debugging and testing. Additionally, QueryX generates Rust code that is type-safe, meaning that developers can be confident that their code is interacting with the database in a safe and predictable way.\\n\\nQueryX also supports a wide range of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more. This makes it a versatile choice for developers who need to work with different databases in their projects.\\n\\nLet's take a closer look at how QueryX works.\\n\\nDefining the Database Schema\\n\\nThe first step in using QueryX is to define the database schema in Rust code. This is done using a simple and intuitive syntax that is similar to defining a Rust struct. Here's an example:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse queryx::queryx;\\n\\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, queryx::FromRow)]\\nstruct User {\\n    id: i32,\\n    name: String,\\n    email: String,\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we define a `User` struct that has three fields: `id`, `name`, and `email`. The `queryx::FromRow` attribute tells QueryX that this struct can be used to represent a row in the database.\\n\\nGenerating the Rust Code\\n\\nOnce we have defined the database schema, we can use QueryX to generate Rust code that interacts with the database. This is done using the `query_as!` macro, which takes a SQL query and a Rust struct and generates code that executes the query and returns the results as instances of the struct.\\n\\nHere's an example:\\n\\n```rust\\nlet users: Vec<User> = query_as!(\\n    User,\\n    \\"SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE name = $1\\",\\n    \\"Alice\\"\\n)\\n.fetch_all(&pool)\\n.await?;\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we use the `query_as!` macro to generate code that executes a SQL query to select all users with the name \\"Alice\\". The `User` struct is used to represent the rows returned by the query. The `fetch_all` method executes the query and returns a vector of `User` instances.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nQueryX is a new ORM library for Rust that provides a schema-first and type-safe approach to database interactions. It allows developers to define their database schema in Rust code and then generate type-safe Rust structs and functions to interact with the database. QueryX is a versatile choice for developers who need to work with different databases in their projects and provides a high level of type safety that can save a lot of time and effort in debugging and testing."}

Together with the secret sauce of in-cluster DNS resolution, you can run a\nprogram on your computer and have it access cluster-internal services that do not have any external IP. The\nprogram would also have access to third-party services that are open to IPs from your cluster, but not to your\nlocal IP.This can be useful for different cases, notably for running utility tools with access to the cluster, or for debugging\nnew services.Running utility programs with access to your cluster #When you run an application with mirrord, and the application connects to a network address or domain name, DNS\nresolution as well as the network connection will be done from the cluster. This lets you run tools locally for\nconfiguring or testing your services on the cluster.Let’s see what this looks like with a little practical example. We have a Kafka cluster set up on Kubernetes1:With mirrord we can use utility tools to manage and test the services on the cluster, with the same ease as if they\nwere running locally. Say we want to read some events from an existing weather-updates topic. We just run Kafka’s\nconsole client, and give it the name of the bootstrap service as its URL.The client connects to the bootstrap server, which tells it what Kafka brokers it should connect to, and it then\nfetches the events from those brokers.All of this works with a simple client running locally on the developer’s machine. No containerizing, no deployment,\nno setup. And the fun part is mirrord operates on the process level, so it doesn’t affect connectivity for the rest\nof your system. This means you can even run multiple applications accessing different clusters or different\nnamespaces at the same time.Access external services through the cluster #When you run an application with mirrord, the connections it initiates will be sent out of a temporary pod on your\nKubernetes cluster. This means your application can connect not only to services in the cluster, but to any\nendpoint in the internet that the cluster has access to. This can be useful if you want your application to\ncommunicate with external services that are configured to only accept communication from your cluster’s IP address,\nor if you want to test your cluster’s network connectivity to external services.In the screenshot below you can see what it looks like when we run curl ifconfig.me (a web service that returns\nthe IP you connect from in its response) with mirrord (IPs partially redacted). When we run the curl command with\nmirrord, it’s sent out of the cluster, so the cluster’s egress IP is returned.Debugging new services with targetless mirrord #Your microservices are deployed on the cluster, so far away. You can see they are there with kubectl. You can even\nport-forward to them. But if you are working on a brand-new microservice that communicates with your existing\nmicroservices, you can’t run it locally, because its requests to the other microservices will fail, especially if\naddressed by cluster-internal domain names. So close, and yet so far. So in order to test your new little service\nwhich barely even does anything, you have to create Kubernetes resources for it, package it in a container, deploy\nit to the cluster, right?Wrong, obviously.Just run it with mirrord, and when it makes requests to services on the cluster, they’ll just work. The DNS\nresolving will be performed on your cluster, and the network traffic will be emitted from within your cluster, so\nyour new little app won’t even notice that it’s running locally and not deployed to the cloud. You can run your app\neither from your IDE (VS Code/IntelliJ-based IDEs) using the mirrord extension, or from the command line, with\nmirrord exec [mirrord-options …] <YOUR-APP> [-- app-args …]. You can iterate through changes in your application,\nrerunning it easily after each little change, and even set breakpoints in your IDE and debug your application,\nwhile it is communicating as if it is running in your cluster.Why is it called “targetless”? #“Targetless” is a new mode for mirrord, which up until now always had to have a target to operate. In the normal\nmode of operation of mirrord, you specify a target container on your cluster (you can specify it by the pod or\neven the deployment, you do not have to know the specific container name). mirrord then spawns an\nagent on the same node as the target, which helps\nyour local program impersonate that container - mirror or steal its incoming traffic, send out network requests\nover it, access the same filesystem and read its environment variables.The main use case for this mode is to debug a new version of an existing application. For example, if you are\nmaking changes to an API endpoint of an existing microservice, you can run the changed version with mirrord, with\nthe existing microservice running in the cloud as a target, and when that service receives requests, they will be\nmirrored (or redirected entirely) to your local application by mirrord. This lets you debug the changed endpoint\nusing traffic from the Kubernetes cluster without deploying a new version after every little change.Can’t I just use kubectl port-forward? #There are some basic tasks that can be achieved with either mirrord or kubectl port-forward in varying degrees of\ncomfort. However, mirrord does something fundamentally different from port-forwarding. mirrord runs an application\nand forwards to the cluster whatever connections it initiates. This means you don’t need to know the ports in\nadvance and configure them before running the application, DNS is resolved in the cluster, UDP is forwarded as well\nas TCP, and connections can also be made to addresses outside the cluster (with the source address of the\ncluster, so if an external service is only open to the cluster’s IP, the application can access it with mirrord).I want to start using it right now! #Look at you, trying out new things, learning every day. Good for you.\nInstalling the mirrord CLI tool is as easy as runningorOr you can install it as a VS Code extension or a\nplugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs.Of course, as mirrord is completely open source you can also\nbuild it from source.Check out the mirrord docs, especially the\nmirrord configuration docs, and the target reference for\nhow to run targetless.\nReach out to us on Discord or GitHub\nfor help, questions, feedback or just to say hi.We used the manifests from Red Hat Developer’s\nKafka in Kubernetes tutorial\nto quickly set up the cluster. ↩︎Share postsign up to our blog post for updates and newsThis field cannot be left blank.Tal ZwickSoftware Engineer @ MetalBear.Share postYou may also like...Approaches in Cloud Development ErgonomicsOctober 31, 2022 by Eyal Bukchin	2023-06-06	{"title":"Easy K8S Connectivity for Local Utils","article":"## Easy K8S Connectivity for Local Utils\\n\\nAre you tired of containerizing and deploying your applications to Kubernetes just to test or debug them?

21	Modern Image Processing Algorithms Implementation in C	https://sod.pixlab.io/articles/modern-image-processing-algorithms-implementation.html	published	reddit	Modern Image Processing Algorithms Overview & Implementation in CImage processing plays a crucial role in numerous fields, ranging from computer vision and medical imaging to surveillance systems and photography. The implementation of image processing algorithms in programming languages like C has become increasingly important due to the need for efficient and optimized solutions especially on embedded devices where computing power is still limited.Implementing modern image processing algorithms in C requires a solid understanding of image representation, data structures, and algorithmic concepts. Uncompressed image data are typically stored as matrices or multidimensional arrays, with each element representing a pixel's intensity or color value. C provides the necessary tools to access and manipulate individual pixels efficiently, making it ideal for algorithm implementation. Most of the algorithms featured here except the patented SIFT & SURF are already implemented in the open source, embedded, computer vision library SOD, and already in production use here at PixLab or FACEIO.More importantly, the intent of this article is to sensibilize the reader that a machine learning approach is not always the best or first solution to solve common Computer Vision problems. Standard image processing algorithms such as Skeletonization, Hough Transform, etc. when mixed and used properly, are traditionally faster than an ML based approach, yet powerful enough to solve those common computer vision challenges.Image Thinning/Skeletonization (Hilditch's Algorithm)Thinning is the operation that seeks a connected region of pixels of a given property set to a small size. Other terms commonly used are "Shrinking", or "Medial Axis Transformation"[1]. Image thinning, is a morphological operation that aims to reduce the width of the regions or objects in a binary image while preserving their connectivity and topology. The goal is to obtain a one-pixel wide representation of the objects in the image, which can be used for further processing or analysis. Image thinning is typically achieved by repeatedly applying a structuring element or a kernel to the binary image, and removing pixels that match certain conditions, such as having fewer neighbors or not being part of a continuous curve.Skeletonization on the other side is the process of transforming binary or grayscale images into a simplified representation that captures the geometric and topological properties of the objects in the input image. Skeletonization provides a simple, yet smart technique by discarding off as many pixels as possible of the target pattern while capturing its essential geometric features without affecting the general shape. That is, after application of the thinning process, the general shape of the object or pattern should still be recognizable[2]. Skeletonization is useful when we are interested not in the size of the pattern but rather in the relative position of the strokes in the pattern[8]. The aim of the skeletonization is to extract a region-based shape feature representing the general form of an object. Image thinning and skeletonization are two important techniques in image processing used to extract and represent the "skeleton" or "centerline" of an object or shape in a binary or grayscale image. They are commonly used in various applications such as computer vision, pattern recognition, medical imaging, and robotics. The skeleton of a binary object as shape descriptor has been proven to be effective for many applications fields. Popular applications of skeletonization include Optical Character Recognition, Medical Imagery, Pattern & Gesture Recognition, and so forth. The thinning process is always the first pass in modern Computer Vision applications and is heavily used here at PixLab for our Passports & ID Cards Scanning API Endpoints (Blog post announcement discussed here).One of the most widely used algorithm for Skeletonization is the Hilditch's algorithm which given an input binary image of some pattern, should produce the following output:Input Binary ImageHilditch's Algorithm OutputHilditch's algorithm is a popular algorithm for image thinning, which reduces the width of regions or objects in a binary image while preserving their connectivity and topology. It was proposed by Richard Hilditch in 1968 and is commonly used for extracting the skeleton or centerline of objects in an image. The algorithm require a binary image as its input to operate. Otherwise, the result is undefined.The basic idea of Hilditch's algorithm is to iteratively scan the binary image and remove pixels that meet certain conditions, until no more pixels can be removed. The algorithm typically operates on a binary image where the objects of interest are represented by foreground pixels (usually denoted as white) and the background is represented by background pixels (usually denoted as black).Hilditch's algorithm iteratively removes pixels from the binary image based on the predefined conditions until the objects in the image are thinned to the desired level, resulting in a one-pixel wide representation of the objects, which can be used for further analysis or processing. It's worth noting that the performance and accuracy of Hilditch's algorithm can be affected by factors such as the input image quality, object shape and size, and the choice of conditions for pixel removal, and it may require parameter tuning or modifications for specific applications.Hilditch's algorithm has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_hilditch_thin_image(). The gist below highlight a typical usage of the Hilditch's algorithm to produce the image output displayed in the section above.Both image thinning and skeletonization are used to reduce the complexity of an object or shape in an image while preserving its essential characteristics. They can help in extracting useful features, such as the shape, orientation, and connectivity of objects, and can be used as a pre-processing step for various image analysis tasks such as content filtering. However, it's important to note that the choice of the thinning or skeletonization algorithm, as well as the input image quality and characteristics, can greatly affect the results and accuracy of these techniques.Image SegmentationImage segmentation is an umbrella term that includes a set of techniques for image processing based on applying a dividing strategy (i.e. a single image is divided in multiple parts)[5]. After the dividing process, each one of the image components is used for a specific purpose, for example, to identify objects or other relevant information. Several methods are used for image segmentation: Thresholding, Color-based, Texture Filters, Clustering, among others. An effective approach to performing image segmentation includes using existing algorithms and tools, and integrating specific components for data analysis, image visualization, and the development and implementation of specific algorithms[5]. The goal of image segmentation is to partition an image into semantically meaningful regions that can be further analyzed, processed, or understood by a computer.Image segmentation has numerous applications in fields such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, image editing, object & face recognition where it is heavily used on FACEIO, our facial authentication web framework (Blog launch announcement here). Image segmentation provides a foundation for higher-level image analysis tasks, such as object detection, object tracking, and image understanding, as it can facilitate the extraction of relevant information from images at a more granular level.There are various methods for image segmentation, ranging from traditional to more advanced techniques, including:One of the most popular approaches for image segmentation is through thresholding. Thresholding takes a grayscale image and replaces each pixel with a black one if its intensity is less than some fixed constant, or a white pixel if the intensity is greater than that constant. The new binary image produced separates dark from bright regions. Mainly because finding pixels that share intensity in a region is not computationally expensive, thresholding is a simple and efficient method for image segmentation[5].Several approaches have been proposed to define thresholding methods. According to the categorization defined by Sezgin and Sankur[7], six strategies were identified[5]:Histogram Shape Methods, which uses information from the image histogram.Clustering Methods, which groups objects in classes, i.e. Background or Foreground.Entropy Methods, which make use of entropy information for foreground and background, or cross-entropy between the original and the binary image.Object Attribute Methods, which evaluate and use the similarities between the original and the binary image.Spatial Methods, which apply higher-order probability distribution and/or correlation between pixels.Local Methods, based on adapting the threshold value to locally defined characteristics.Various thresholding & edge detection techniques are widely available and implemented in SOD via sod_binarize_image(), sod_threshold_image(), sod_canny_edge_image(), sod_sobel_image(), etc.Input (Grayscale colorspace) ImageFixed Thresholding OutputThe gist below showcase how to obtain a binary image via fixed thresholding to produce the image output displayed above.Otsu's MethodPut it simply, Otsu's method (named after Nobuyuki Otsu) is a popular thresholding algorithm for image segmentation, belonging to the clustering category, and is usually used for thresholding and binarization. Thresholding is used to extract an object from its background by assigning an intensity value T (threshold) for each pixel such that each pixel is either classified as foreground or background point.Otsu's method is a simple yet effective method for image thresholding, as it automatically determines the threshold value without requiring any user-defined parameter. It has been widely used in various image processing applications, such as image segmentation, object detection, and image analysis. However, it may not be suitable for all images or scenarios, as it assumes that the foreground and background classes have distinct intensity or color values, and may not perform well in cases where this assumption is not metInput ImageOtsu's Algorithm OutputOtsu's method works mainly with the image histogram, looking at the pixel values and the regions that the user wants to segment out, rather than looking at the edges of an image. It tries to segment the image making the variance on each of the classes minimal. The algorithm works well for images that contain two classes of pixels, following a bi-modal histogram distribution. The algorithm divides the image histogram into two classes, by using a threshold such as the in-class variability is very small. This way, each class will be as compact as possible. The spatial relationship between pixels is not taken into account, so regions that have similar pixel values but are in completely different locations in the image will be merged when computing the histogram, meaning that Otsu’s algorithm treats them as the same[5]. The algorithm works as follows:Otsu's method has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_otsu_binarize_image(). The gist below highlight a typical usage of the Otsu's algorithm to produce the image output displayed above.Minutiae Features ExtractionMinutiae features extraction is a common technique used in fingerprint recognition, which is a widely used biometric authentication method in computer vision. Fingerprint recognition is based on the unique and distinct ridge patterns and characteristics present in fingerprints, which are used to identify individuals.Fingerprints are the oldest and most widely used form of biometric identification. Everyone is known to have mostly unique, immutable fingerprints. As most Automatic Fingerprint Recognition Systems are based on local ridge features known as minutiae, marking minutiae accurately and rejecting false ones is very important. However, fingerprint images get degraded and corrupted due to variations in skin and impression conditions. Thus, image enhancement techniques such as Hilditch Thinning, Thresholding, etc. are employed prior to minutiae extraction. A critical step in automatic fingerprint matching is to reliably extract minutiae from the input fingerprint image[6].Fingerprints are the most widely used parameter for personal identification amongst all biometrics. Fingerprint identification is commonly employed in forensic science to aid criminal investigations etc. A fingerprint is a unique pattern of ridges and valleys on the surface of a finger of an individual. A ridge is defined as a single curved segment, and a valley is the region between two adjacent ridges. Minutiae points (img.2) are the local ridge discontinuities, which are of two types: ridge endings and bifurcations. A good quality image has around 40 to 100 minutiae[6]. It is these minutiae points which are used for determining uniqueness of a fingerprint.Input Grayscaled Fingerprintsod_minutiae() OutputMinutiae are the ridge and valley characteristics or details found in fingerprints, such as ridge endings, ridge bifurcations, and short ridges. Ridge endings are points where ridges terminate, while ridge bifurcations are points where ridges split into two branches. Short ridges are small ridge segments that connect two longer ridges.Minutiae features extraction has been successfully deployed in SOD via the exported function sod_minutiae(). The gist below extracts ridges and bifurcations from a fingerprint image using sod_minutiae().Hough TransformThe Hough transform is a popular image processing technique used for detecting lines or other parametric shapes in images. It was developed by Paul Hough in 1962 and has since been widely used in computer vision and image analysis applications. Hough transform works by converting image points from the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y) to a parameter space, known as the Hough space, which is represented by a different set of coordinates, typically denoted as (θ, ρ), where θ represents the angle of the line and ρ represents the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line along the line's normal vector.Hough transform is a robust technique for detecting lines in images, even in the presence of noise or partial occlusion. It is widely used in various image processing and computer vision applications, such as shape recognition, document scanning, and traffic sign recognition.Input Binary ImageHough Lines Detection OutputHough transform can be used for detecting lines in an input image or video frame using the following steps:Hough transform have been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_hough_lines_detect(). The gist below highlight a typical usage on how to extract straight lines on a given input image or video frame.Canny Edge DetectionCanny edge is a popular image processing algorithm used for detecting edges in a given image while suppressing noise. It is very popular among computer vision systems, and was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. A typical output of a canny edged image is shown below:Input ImageCanny Edge OutputThe main steps for outputting a canny edged image are:Canny edge has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_canny_edge_image(). The result of the Canny edge detection algorithm is a binary image where the strong edge pixels form continuous curves representing the detected edges. These edges correspond to the significant changes in intensity or color in the original image. The gist below highlight a typical invocation of the canny edge detection algorithm to produce the image output displayed in the section above.Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) AlgorithmThe scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm is a widely used, patented method for extracting distinctive and robust features from images. It was proposed by David Lowe in 1999 and has become a fundamental technique in image processing, computer vision, and object recognition tasks. The SIFT algorithm is particularly effective in handling changes in scale, rotation, affine transformations, and partial occlusions.SIFT, extracts a set of descriptors from an image[10]. The extracted descriptors are invariant to image translation, rotation and scaling (zoom-out). SIFT descriptors have also proved to be robust to a wide family of image transformations, such as slight changes of viewpoint, noise, blur, contrast changes, scene deformation, while remaining discriminating enough for matching purposes.Original SIFT algorithm flow [14]SIFT consists of two successive and independent operations: The detection of interesting points (i.e. keypoints) and the extraction of a descriptor associated to each of them. Since these descriptors are robust, they are usually used for matching pairs of images. Object recognition and video stabilization are other popular application examples.SIFT detects a series of keypoints from a multiscale image representation. That is, it locates certain key points and then furnishes them with quantitative information (so-called descriptors)[12]. This multiscale representation consists of a family of increasingly blurred images. Each keypoint is a blob-like structure whose center position (x, y) and characteristic scale σ are accurately located. SIFT computes the dominant orientation θ over a region surrounding each one of these keypoints. For each keypoint, the quadruple (x, y, σ, θ) defines the center, size and orientation of a normalized patch where the SIFT descriptor is computed. As a result of this normalization, SIFT keypoint descriptors are in theory invariant to any translation, rotation and scale change. The descriptor encodes the spatial gradient distribution around a keypoint by a 128-dimensional vector. This feature vector is generally used to match keypoints extracted from different images.The figure above, shows a flow diagram of the original SIFT algorithm. Hierarchical algorithm is adopted to obtain robustness to a scale change. The SIFT descriptor generation consists of Gaussian filtering, key-point extraction and descriptor vector generation. The input image is smoothed by Gaussian filtering for key-point extraction. Adjacent Gaussian filtered images are subtracted for difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) generation. Key-point is detected by searching on DOG. Key-point detection uses three DOG images. Maxima and minima of DOG images are detected by comparing a pixel in middle scale to its 26 neighbors in 3×3 regions at the current and adjacent scales. Finally, SIFT descriptor vectors are obtained by calculating a gradient histogram of luminance around the key-point. The whole process can be divided into several key steps as outlined below:Finally, an open source C implementation of the SIFT algorithm, can be found at https://github.com/robwhess/opensift.Sobel OperatorThe Sobel operator is a widely used edge detection operator in image processing. It is a simple and computationally efficient filter that is commonly used to detect edges or boundaries between regions of different intensities in an image. The Sobel operator is typically applied to grayscale images, but it can also be used on color images by applying it separately to each color channel.The Sobel operator works by convolving a small filter or kernel with the input image. The filter is a small matrix typically of size 3x3 or 5x5, and it consists of two separate kernels, one for detecting vertical edges and one for detecting horizontal edges. These two kernels are often referred to as the Sobel operators or Sobel kernels.To apply the Sobel operator to an input image, the operator is convolved with the image by placing the kernel at each pixel location and performing element-wise multiplication and summation. The result is a new image, often referred to as the gradient image or edge map, which represents the strength and direction of edges in the original image.The vertical Sobel operator highlights edges that run vertically in the image, such as edges that represent changes in intensity from top to bottom. The horizontal Sobel operator highlights edges that run horizontally in the image, such as edges that represent changes in intensity from left to right. By applying both vertical and horizontal Sobel operators, the Sobel operator can detect edges in multiple orientations.The Sobel operator is commonly used in various image processing tasks, such as image segmentation, object detection, and feature extraction. It is a popular choice for edge detection due to its simplicity and effectiveness in highlighting edges in images.Input Grayscaled ImageSobel Operator OutputThe Sobel operator has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_sobel_image(). The gist below highlight a typical invocation of the Sobel operator to produce the image output displayed in the section above.Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) AlgorithmSpeeded Up Robust Features or SURF for short is a patented algorithm used mostly in computer vision applications. SURF fall in the category of feature descriptors by extracting keypoints from different regions of a given image and thus is very useful in finding similarity between images. It was introduced by Herbert Bay et al. in 2006 as an efficient and robust alternative to the SIFT algorithm. SURF features are designed to be invariant to scale, rotation, and changes in viewpoint, making them suitable for various image analysis tasks.SURF Keypoints detection [11]SURF locates features using an approximation to the determinant of the Hessian, chosen for its stability and repeatability, as well as its speed. An ideal filter would construct the Hessian by convolving the second-order derivatives of a Gaussian of a given scale σ with the input image. The SURF algorithm operates as follow:Finally, SURF is advertised to perform faster compared to previously proposed schemes like SIFT. This is achieved (as stated by its designers) by:BLOB DetectionBlob detection is a commonly used technique in image processing and computer vision for detecting regions or regions of interest (ROIs) in an image that have similar properties, such as intensity, color, or texture. Blobs are typically characterized by their intensity or color properties, and they can represent objects, features, or structures of interest in an image.Input Binary ImageIsolated Blob RegionsBlob detection algorithms typically operate on grayscale or color images and involve the following steps:A general purpose blob detector has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_image_find_blobs(). The gist below highlight a typical usage of the built-in blob detector to isolate potential regions of interest for an OCR system for example.Blob detection is widely used in various image processing and computer vision applications, such as document scanning, Face Anti-Spoofing, image analysis, and medical imaging. It is a versatile technique that can be adapted to different types of images and properties of interest, making it a powerful tool for many computer vision tasks.ConclusionIn conclusion, the implementation of modern image processing algorithms in C offers a powerful and efficient approach for handling complex image analysis tasks. C's low-level nature and control over memory management provide opportunities for optimizing computational performance. With a solid understanding of image representation, data structures, and algorithmic concepts, developers can harness the potential of C to create robust and efficient solutions for image processing applications.References Porting a Face Detector Written in C to WebAssemblyList of Publication Home Getting Started API Downloads License Support	2023-06-06	{"title":"\\"Modern Image Processing Algorithms Implementation in C: A Guide for Developers\\"","article":"\\nThis article was originally published on the PixLab blog.\\n\\nImage processing is a critical component of many industries, from medical imaging to photography. As computing power becomes increasingly limited on embedded devices, the implementation of image processing algorithms in programming languages like C has become more important than ever. In this article, we will provide an overview of modern image processing algorithms and their implementation in C.\\n\\nTo implement modern image processing algorithms in C, developers must have a solid understanding of image representation, data structures, and algorithmic concepts. Uncompressed image data is typically stored as matrices or multidimensional arrays, with each element representing a pixel's intensity or color value. C provides the necessary tools to access and manipulate individual pixels efficiently, making it an ideal language for algorithm implementation.\\n\\nWhile there are many image processing algorithms available, we will focus on a few key ones. The Hough Transform algorithm is used to detect lines in an image, while Skeletonization is used to reduce the thickness of objects in an image. These algorithms, when used together, can provide powerful image processing capabilities.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that a machine learning approach is not always the best or first solution to solve common Computer Vision problems. Standard image processing algorithms such as the ones mentioned above can be just as effective, if not more so, when used properly.\\n\\nFor those interested in implementing these algorithms in C, the open-source, embedded computer vision library SOD already includes most of them, with the exception of the patented SIFT & SURF algorithms. SOD is already in production use at PixLab and FACEIO.\\n\\nTo give developers a better understanding of how these algorithms work, we have included some sample code snippets below:\\n\\n// Hough Transform Algorithm\\nfor (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {\\n    for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {\\n        if (image[y][x] == 255) {\\n            for (int theta = 0; theta < 180; theta++) {\\n                int r = (int)(x * cos(theta) + y * sin(theta));\\n                accumulator[r + 90][theta]++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// Skeletonization Algorithm\\nfor (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {\\n    for (int y = 1; y < height - 1; y++) {\\n        for (int x = 1; x < width - 1; x++) {\\n            int p2 = image[y - 1][x];\\n            int p3 = image[y - 1][x + 1];\\n            int p4 = image[y][x + 1];\\n            int p5 = image[y + 1][x + 1];\\n            int p6 = image[y + 1][x];\\n            int p7 = image[y + 1][x - 1];\\n            int p8 = image[y][x - 1];\\n            int p9 = image[y - 1][x - 1];\\n            int A = (p2 == 0 && p3 == 1) + (p3 == 0 && p4 == 1) +\\n                    (p4 == 0 && p5 == 1) + (p5 == 0 && p6 == 1) +\\n                    (p6 == 0 && p7 == 1) + (p7 == 0 && p8 == 1) +\\n                    (p8 == 0 && p9 == 1) + (p9 == 0 && p2 == 1);\\n            int B = p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 + p9;\\n            int m1 = i == 0 ? (p2 * p4 * p6) : (p2 * p4 * p8);\\n            int m2 = i == 0 ? (p4 * p6 * p8) : (p2 * p6 * p8);\\n            if (A == 1 && (B >= 2 && B <= 6) && m1 == 0 && m2 == 0) {\\n                skeletonized[y][x] = 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nIn conclusion, implementing modern image processing algorithms in C can provide developers with efficient and optimized solutions, especially on embedded devices. By using standard image processing algorithms like the Hough Transform and Skeletonization, developers can achieve powerful image processing capabilities without relying on machine learning."}

Unpickling is the reverse process of deserializing a byte stream back into a Python object.Pickling and unpickling can be useful when you want to:For example, suppose you have a list of dictionaries that contains some information about your favorite athletes:If you want to save this data to a file or send it to another Python program, you can use pickling and unpickling to do so easily and efficiently.How to pickle and unpickle objects in PythonTo pickle and unpickle objects in Python, you need to use the pickle module. The pickle module provides two main functions: pickle.dump and pickle.load.pickle.dump takes an object as an argument and writes it to a file-like object (such as an open file or a BytesIO object) in binary format. The file-like object must be opened in binary write mode (wb).pickle.load takes a file-like object as an argument and reads the data from it. It returns the object constructed from the data. The file-like object must be opened in binary read mode (rb).Here is an example of how to pickle and unpickle the athletes list from the previous section:The output is:As you can see, the new_athletes list is identical to the original athletes list. The pickle module has preserved the structure and the content of the list.You can also use the pickle.dumps and pickle.loads functions to pickle and unpickle objects in memory, without using a file. pickle.dumps returns a bytes object that contains the pickled representation of the object, while pickle.loads takes a bytes object and returns the unpickled object.Here is an example of how to use these functions:The output is:As you can see, the pickled data is a bytes object that contains the binary representation of the data dictionary. The restored_data dictionary is identical to the original data dictionary.What are the advantages and disadvantages of pickling and unpickling in Python?Pickling and unpickling in Python have some advantages and disadvantages that you should be aware of before using them.Some of the advantages are:Some of the disadvantages are:What are some best practices for pickling and unpickling in Python?To use pickling and unpickling in Python effectively and safely, here are some best practices that you should follow:You can find the all written code in this blog post on replit.ConclusionIn this blog post, you have learned:By following these tips and techniques, you can use pickling and unpickling in Python effectively and safely for your own projects.If you found this blog post helpful, please share it with your friends or colleagues who might be interested in learning more about pickling and unpickling in Python.And if you have any questions or feedback, please leave a comment below.

All Rights Reserved.	2023-06-08	{"title":"A Guide to Pickling and Unpickling in Python","article":"Python is a popular programming language that is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning. One of the features that make Python a versatile language is its ability to pickle and unpickle objects. In this article, we will explore what pickling and unpickling are, how they work, and how you can use them in your Python projects.\\n\\nWhat is Pickling and Unpickling in Python?\\nPickling is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream, which can be stored in a file, a database, or sent over a network. Unpickling is the reverse process of converting a byte stream back into a Python object. Pickling and unpickling are useful when you want to save or transfer a complex Python object, such as a list, a dictionary, a class, or a function, without losing its attributes and behaviors.\\n\\nHow Does Pickling and Unpickling Work?\\nPython provides a built-in module called pickle that implements pickling and unpickling. The pickle module uses a protocol to serialize and deserialize Python objects. The protocol determines the format of the byte stream and the level of compatibility between different versions of Python. The current protocol version is 5, which is compatible with Python 3.10 and later.\\n\\nTo pickle an object, you can use the dump() function of the pickle module, which writes the byte stream to a file or a stream. Here's an example:\\n\\n```\\nimport pickle\\n\\ndata = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'hobbies': ['reading', 'traveling']}\\nwith open('data.pickle', 'wb') as f:\\n    pickle.dump(data, f)\\n```\\n\\nThis code creates a dictionary called `data` that contains some personal information about a person. Then, it opens a file called `data.pickle` in binary mode and uses the dump() function to pickle the data and write it to the file.\\n\\nTo unpickle an object, you can use the load() function of the pickle module, which reads the byte stream from a file or a stream and returns the corresponding Python object. Here's an example:\\n\\n```\\nimport pickle\\n\\nwith open('data.pickle', 'rb') as f:\\n    data = pickle.load(f)\\nprint(data)\\n```\\n\\nThis code opens the same file `data.pickle` in binary mode and uses the load() function to unpickle the data and assign it to a variable called `data`. Then, it prints the contents of the data, which should be the same as the original dictionary.\\n\\nTips for Using Pickling and Unpickling in Python\\nHere are some tips for using pickling and unpickling effectively and safely in your Python projects:\\n\\n- Use pickling and unpickling only for trusted data sources, as unpickling can execute arbitrary code and pose a security risk.\\n- Use the latest protocol version that is compatible with your Python version, as it provides better performance and security.\\n- Avoid pickling large or complex objects, as they can consume a lot of memory and cause performance issues.\\n- Use compression to reduce the size of the byte stream, especially when transferring over a network or storing in a database.\\n- Use a context manager to ensure that the file or stream is properly closed after pickling or unpickling.\\n\\nConclusion\\nPickling and unpickling are powerful features of Python that allow you to save and transfer complex objects easily and efficiently. By understanding how pickling and unpickling work and following some best practices, you can use these features effectively and safely in your Python projects."}

Vector search is one such tool that is gaining popularity in the world of sports analytics. In particular, it can be used to match historical baseball player stats and identify players with similar performance profiles.\\n\\nVector search is a technique that involves representing data points as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors can then be compared using distance metrics to identify similar data points. In the case of baseball player stats, we can represent each player's performance across different categories (e.g. batting average, home runs, RBIs) as a vector. By comparing these vectors, we can identify players with similar performance profiles.\\n\\nOne application of this technique is to identify historical players who are similar to current players. For example, we can use vector search to identify players from the past who had similar performance profiles to current stars like Mike Trout or Clayton Kershaw. This can help us gain a better understanding of how these current players compare to historical greats.\\n\\nTo implement vector search for baseball player stats, we can use a machine learning library like scikit-learn in Python. Here's an example code snippet:\\n\\n```\\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Create a matrix of player stats\\nplayer_stats = np.array([\\n    [0.300, 40, 120],\\n    [0.280, 35, 110],\\n    [0.320, 45, 130],\\n    [0.290, 30, 100]\\n])\\n\\n# Compute cosine similarity between each pair of players\\nsimilarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(player_stats)\\n\\n# Identify players with similar performance profiles\\nsimilar_players = np.argsort(similarity_matrix[0])[-2:]\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we create a matrix of player stats where each row represents a player and each column represents a different category of performance. We then compute the cosine similarity between each pair of players to create a similarity matrix. Finally, we identify the players with the most similar performance profiles to the first player in the matrix.\\n\\nVector search is just one of many tools that can be used to analyze baseball player stats. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we can gain new insights into the game and its history. As the field of sports analytics continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative approaches to analyzing and understanding data in the world of sports."}

The Exploit Database is a non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec. The Exploit Database is a CVE compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away. The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting, and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases, this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information. The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk recorded at DEFCON 13. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user. Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to show examples of vulnerable web sites. After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB over to OffSec in November 2010, and it is now maintained as an extension of the Exploit Database. Today, the GHDB includes searches for other online search engines such as Bing, and other online repositories like GitHub, producing different, yet equally valuable results.

It quickly gained popularity due to its \\"write once, run anywhere\\" philosophy, which allowed developers to write code that could be run on any platform that had a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. However, this flexibility came with a caveat: the Java sandbox.\\n\\nThe Java sandbox was a security feature designed to prevent untrusted code from accessing system resources. It worked by restricting the actions that a Java program could perform, such as accessing the file system or network. This was achieved by running the code in a \\"sandbox\\" environment, which was isolated from the rest of the system.\\n\\nFor the past twenty years, developers have been trying to escape the Java sandbox. This has led to the discovery of numerous vulnerabilities and exploits, which have been used by attackers to gain access to systems and steal sensitive information. In this article, we will take a look back at some of the most notable Java sandbox escapes and explore what the future holds for Java security.\\n\\nOne of the most famous Java sandbox escapes was the AppletClassLoader vulnerability, which was discovered in 1997. This vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the system. It was quickly patched, but it was just the beginning of a long line of Java security issues.\\n\\nIn 2012, the Java sandbox was once again in the spotlight when the Flashback malware exploited a vulnerability in the Java browser plugin. This malware infected over 600,000 Macs and was one of the largest Mac botnets ever discovered. This incident led Apple to disable the Java browser plugin by default on all Macs.\\n\\nIn 2013, another high-profile Java sandbox escape was discovered. The vulnerability, known as CVE-2013-2465, allowed an attacker to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the system. This vulnerability affected Java 7 Update 21 and earlier versions. Oracle quickly released a patch, but the incident highlighted the ongoing security issues with Java.\\n\\nDespite these incidents, Java remains a popular programming language. In fact, it is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. However, the Java sandbox is still a point of concern for many developers and security experts.\\n\\nIn recent years, Oracle has made significant efforts to improve Java security. They have released numerous patches and updates to address vulnerabilities and have implemented new security features, such as the Java Security Manager. This has helped to make Java more secure, but there is still work to be done.\\n\\nLooking ahead, the future of Java security looks promising. Oracle has committed to improving Java security and has made it a top priority. They have also introduced new security features, such as the Java Flight Recorder, which provides real-time monitoring of Java applications.\\n\\nIn addition, there are numerous third-party security tools and frameworks available for Java developers. These tools can help to identify and address security vulnerabilities in Java code.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Java sandbox has been a point of concern for developers and security experts for the past twenty years. However, with ongoing efforts to improve Java security and the availability of third-party security tools, the future looks promising. Java remains a powerful and flexible programming language, and with the right security measures in place, it can be used to develop secure and reliable applications."}

You'll learn how to integrate Auth0 with Flask to implement the following security features:\nHow to add user login, sign-up, and logout to Flask applications.\nHow to get user profile information to personalize Flask views.\nHow to protect Flask views from unauthorized access.\nHow to make API calls from Flask to request data from a protected API.\nThis guide uses the Authlib library, which provides developers with a high-level API to handle OAuth and OpenID Connect servers from a low level specification implementation to integration with the major Python frameworks.\nHow Does Auth0 Work?\nWith the help of Auth0, you don't need to be an expert on identity protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, to understand how to secure your web application stack.\nYou first integrate your Flask application with Auth0. Your application will then redirect users to an Auth0 customizable login page when they need to log in. Once your users log in successfully, Auth0 redirects them back to your Flask app, returning JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with their authentication and user information.\nGet the Starter Application\nWe have created a starter project to help you learn Flask security concepts through hands-on practice. You can focus on building Flask views and services to secure your application.\nStart by cloning the web-app_flask_python_hello-world repository on its starter branch:\nCOMMANDCopygit clone -b starter [email protected]:auth0-developer-hub/web-app_flask_python_hello-world.git\nOnce you clone the repo, make web-app_flask_python_hello-world your current directory:\nCOMMANDCopycd web-app_flask_python_hello-world\nNext, to work with the project we will create a virtual environment:\nCOMMANDCopypython3 -m venv venv\nActivate the virtual environment:\nMACOSWINDOWSLINUXcopysource venv/bin/activate\nInstall the project dependencies as follows:\nCOMMANDCopypip install -r requirements.txt\nThis starter Flask project offers a functional application with views and services to hydrate the user interface. It is important to notice that the service implemented in the starter project simulates the external API by placing the responses directly on the code. Later on the guide, you'll integrate this Flask application with a real API server using a backend technology of your choice.\nExecute this command to run your Flask application on port 4040:\nCOMMANDCopyflask --app app run --port 4040\nYou'll see the following output on the command line: * Serving Flask app 'app' * Debug mode: offWARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead. * Running on http://127.0.0.1:4040Press CTRL+C to quit\nNow you should visit http://localhost:4040/ to access the running application.\nConfigure Flask with Auth0\nFollow these steps to get started with the Auth0 Identity Platform quickly:\nSign up and create an Auth0 application\nAuthentication For DevelopersGet Auth0 for free with up to 7,000 active users and unlimited logins. No credit card required.Authentication For DevelopersGet Auth0 for free with up to 7,000 active users and unlimited logins. No credit card required.Create a Free Auth0 Account→\nA free account also offers you:\nAuth0 Universal Login for Web, iOS & Android.\nUp to 2 social identity providers like Google, GitHub, and Twitter.\nUp to 3 Actions, Rules, & Hooks to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities.\nDuring the sign-up process, you create something called an Auth0 Tenant, representing the product or service to which you are adding authentication.\nOnce you sign in, Auth0 takes you to the Dashboard. In the left sidebar menu, click on "Applications".\nThen, click the "Create Application" button. A modal opens up with a form to provide a name for the application and choose its type. Use the following values:\nNameCopyAuth0 Flask Web Application\nApplication Type<img alt="Regular Web Applications" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" srcSet="https://cdn.auth0.com/manhattan/versions/1.3431.0/assets/regular_web.svg 1x, https://cdn.auth0.com/manhattan/versions/1.3431.0/assets/regular_web.svg 2x" src="https://cdn.auth0.com/manhattan/versions/1.3431.0/assets/regular_web.svg"/>Regular Web Applications\nClick the "Create" button to complete the process. Your Auth0 application page loads up.\nIn the next step, you'll learn how to help Flask and Auth0 communicate.\nWhat's the relationship between Auth0 Tenants and Auth0 Applications?\nLet's say that you have a photo-sharing Flask app called "Flasktagram". You then would create an Auth0 tenant called flasktagram. From a customer perspective, Flasktagram is that customer's product or service.\nNow, say that Flasktagram is available on three platforms: web as a single-page application and Android and iOS as a native mobile application. If each platform needs authentication, you need to create three Auth0 applications to provide the product with everything it needs to authenticate users through that platform.\nFlasktagram users belong to the Auth0 Flasktagram tenant, which shares them across its Auth0 applications.\nCreate a communication bridge between Flask and Auth0\nWhen using the Auth0 Identity Platform, you don't have to build login forms. Auth0 offers a Universal Login Page to reduce the overhead of adding and managing authentication.\nHow does Universal Login work?\nYour Flask application will redirect users to Auth0 whenever they trigger an authentication request. Auth0 will present them with a login page. Once they log in, Auth0 will redirect them back to your Flask application. For that redirection to happen securely, you must specify in your Auth0 Application Settings the URLs to which Auth0 can redirect users once it authenticates them.\nAs such, click on the "Settings" tab of your Auth0 Application page, locate the "Application URIs" section, and fill in the following values:\nAllowed Callback URLsCopyhttp://localhost:4040/callback\nThe above value is the URL that Auth0 can use to redirect your users after they successfully log in.\nAllowed Logout URLsCopyhttp://localhost:4040\nThe above value is the URL that Auth0 can use to redirect your users after they log out.\nAllowed Web OriginsCopyhttp://localhost:4040\nScroll down and click the "Save Changes" button.\nDo not close this page yet. You'll need some of its information in the next section.\nAdd the Auth0 configuration variables to Flask\nFrom the Auth0 Application Settings page, you need the Auth0 Domain and Client ID values to allow your Flask application to use the communication bridge you created.\nWhat exactly is an Auth0 Domain, an Auth0 Client ID and a Auth0 Client Secret?\nDomain\nWhen you created a new Auth0 account, Auth0 asked you to pick a name for your tenant. This name, appended with auth0.com, is your Auth0 Domain. It's the base URL that you will use to access the Auth0 APIs and the URL where you'll redirect users to log in.\nYou can also use custom domains to allow Auth0 to do the authentication heavy lifting for you without compromising your branding experience.\nClient ID\nEach application is assigned a Client ID upon creation, which is an alphanumeric string, and it's the unique identifier for your application (such as q8fij2iug0CmgPLfTfG1tZGdTQyGaTUA). You cannot modify the Client ID. You will use the Client ID to identify the Auth0 Application to which the Flask application needs to connect.\nWarning: Another critical piece of information present in the "Settings" is the Client Secret. This secret protects your resources by only granting tokens to requestors if they're authorized. Think of it as your application's password, which must be kept confidential at all times. If anyone gains access to your Client Secret, they can impersonate your application and access protected resources.\nHead back to your Auth0 application page and click on the "Settings" tab.\nLocate the "Basic Information" section and follow these steps to get the Auth0 Domain, Auth0 Client ID, and Auth0 Client Secret values:\n<img alt="Auth0 application settings to enable user authentication" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:contain" class="markdown-image_image__5QLXt" sizes="100vw" srcSet="/resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="/resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.auth0.com%2Fblog%2Fdeveloper-hub%2Fhello-world-web-app-settings.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/>\nWhen you enter a value in the input fields present on this page, any code snippet that uses such value updates to reflect it. Using the input fields makes it easy to copy and paste code as you follow along.\nAs such, enter the "Domain" and "Client ID" values in the following fields to set up your Flask application in the next section:\nAuth0 DomainAuth0 Client ID\nFor security, these configuration values are stored in memory and only used locally. They are gone as soon as you refresh the page! As an extra precaution, you should use values from an Auth0 test application instead of a production one.\nThese variables let your Flask application identify as an authorized party to interact with the Auth0 authentication server.\nNow, create a new .config file under the Flask project directory as follows:\n.configCopy[AUTH0]CLIENT_ID=AUTH0-CLIENT-IDCLIENT_SECRET=AUTH0-CLIENT-SECRETDOMAIN=AUTH0-DOMAIN\n[WEBAPP]SECRET_KEY=\nGenerate a string for SECRET_KEY using openssl rand -hex 32 from your shell.\nHead back to the "Settings" tab of your Auth0 application page in the Auth0 Dashboard to get the value for CLIENT_SECRET.\nLocate the "Client Secret" field, copy its value, and paste it as the CLIENT_SECRET configuration value in the .config file.\nThis page does not store the value of the Auth0 Client Secret. Not even in memory. Think of it as your application's password, which must be kept confidential at all times. If anyone gains access to your Client Secret, they can impersonate your application and access protected resources. The Auth0 Client Secret protects your resources by only granting authentication-related credentials in the form of tokens to requestors if they're authorized.\nSet Up Auth0\nTo integrate your Flask application with Auth0 we'll use the Authlib library, which will handle all the OAuth and OpenID Connect for us.\nNext, let's install and integrate the library into the application.\nInstall dependencies\nThe starter branch already provides all the requirements you need to run this project, but make sure you have the following three libraries installed in your environment:\nrequirements.txtCopyflask>=2.2.2authlib>=1.2.0requests>=2.28.2\nYou should now run pip install -r requirements.txt from your shell to make these dependencies available to your project.\nInitialize Auth0 configuration\nSo far our application registers one blueprint that registers the application views.\nTo set up Auth0 we'll register a new blueprint that will take care of all auth views and logic.\nStart by creating a new directory at the root of your project named auth and add the following empty files inside of that directory:\n__init__.pydecorators.pyviews.py\nNow we can start by setting up authlib and register a new Auth0 OAuth provider by adding the following code to the auth/views.py file:\nauth/views.pyCopyfrom flask import Blueprint, current_appfrom authlib.integrations.flask_client import OAuth\nfrom config import config\nauth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__)\nauth0_config = config['AUTH0']oauth = OAuth(current_app)\ndomain = auth0_config["DOMAIN"]client_id = auth0_config["CLIENT_ID"]client_secret = auth0_config["CLIENT_SECRET"]\noauth.register( "auth0", client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, client_kwargs={ "scope": "openid profile email", }, server_metadata_url=f'https://{domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration')\nOnce we provide authlib with the Auth0 server details such as the client_id, client_secrent, scope, and server_metadata_url, the library is fully set up and we can start creating the views we need to handle the authentication requests with the Auth0 Authentication Server.\nYou'll have to register the newly created blueprint to host all the authentication views as well as setting the application key we previously configured:\napp.pyCopyimport json\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nfrom config import config # 👈 new codefrom webapp.views import webapp_bpfrom auth.views import auth_bp # 👈 new code\ndef to_pretty_json(obj: dict) -> str: return json.dumps(obj, default=lambda o: o.__dict__, indent=4)\ndef page_not_found(e): return render_template('404.html'), 404\ndef create_app(): """ Configuration of the app """ app = Flask(__name__) app.secret_key = config["WEBAPP"]["SECRET_KEY"] # 👈 new code app.jinja_env.filters['to_pretty_json'] = to_pretty_json app.register_error_handler(404, page_not_found) app.register_blueprint(auth_bp, url_prefix='/') # 👈 new code app.register_blueprint(webapp_bp, url_prefix='/') return app\nif __name__ == '__main__': app = create_app() app.run(host='0.0.0.0')\nWhat about using scopes?\nA property that you are configuring too for your OmniAuth-Auth0 strategy is the scope property. Here you're providing the OpenID Connect Scopes: openid profile email.\nopenid: This scope informs the Auth0 Authorization Server that the Client is making an OpenID Connect (OIDC) request to verify the user's identity. OpenID Connect is an authentication protocol.\nprofile: This scope value requests access to the user's default profile information, such as name, nickname, and picture.\nemail: This scope value requests access to the email and email_verified information.\nThe details of the OpenID Connect Scopes go into the ID Token. However, you can define custom API scopes to implement access control. You'll identify those custom scopes in the calls that your client applications make to that API. Auth0 includes API scopes in the access token as the scope claim value.\nThe concepts about API scopes or permissions are better covered in an Auth0 API tutorial such as "Use TypeScript to Create a Secure API with Node.js and Express: Role-Based Access Control".\nCreate the Auth0 callback view\nWith the Auth0 configuration implemented you'll need to create a view to handle the authentication callback.\nauth/views.pyCopyfrom flask import Blueprint, redirect, session, current_app # 👈 Updated codefrom authlib.integrations.flask_client import OAuth\nfrom config import config\nauth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__)\nauth0_config = config['AUTH0']oauth = OAuth(current_app)\ndomain = auth0_config["DOMAIN"]client_id = auth0_config["CLIENT_ID"]client_secret = auth0_config["CLIENT_SECRET"]\noauth.register( "auth0", client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, client_kwargs={ "scope": "openid profile email", }, server_metadata_url=f'https://{domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration')\n# 👇 new code@auth_bp.route("/callback", methods=["GET", "POST"])def callback(): """ Callback redirect from Auth0 """ token = oauth.auth0.authorize_access_token() session["user"] = token # The app assumes for a /profile path to be available, change here if it's not return redirect("/profile")# 👆 new code\nAfter the user attempts to log in, either if it was successful or not, Auth0 will redirect them to the /callback endpoint and the router will call the view that matches with it in the application.\nIn the callback view we authenticate the user coming from the request, store the user token in session and redirect the user to the profile endpoint.\nIn case there's an error, we'll respond with a 400 error status code.\nCreate the Login Button\nYou have created the callback view to handle a login flow in your app. Now you need to create a Login Button that will trigger the authentication flow.\nLet's create a new template that will handle the authentication buttons in the Nav Bar:\nCOMMANDCopytouch webapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.html\nNext, fill it up with the following content:\nwebapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.htmlCopy<div class="nav-bar__buttons"> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}" class="button__login" >Log In</a></div>\nWe'll create an additional file for the mobile view:\nCOMMANDCopytouch webapp/templates/navigation/mobile/nav_bar_buttons.html\nNext, fill it up with the following content:\nwebapp/templates/navigation/mobile/nav_bar_buttons.htmlCopy<div class="mobile-nav-bar__buttons"> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}" class="button__login" >Log In</a></div>\nIn both templates you are creating a button labeled "Log In". When the users click on this button they will make a GET request to /login endpoint.\nThis endpoint is not defined yet, but you'll implement it in the next section.\nBut before we do that, let's add the new buttons to the nav bar.\nFor the Desktop template, make the following changes:\nwebapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar.htmlCopy<div class="nav-bar__container"> <nav class="nav-bar"> {% include 'navigation/desktop/nav_bar_brand.html' %} {% include 'navigation/desktop/nav_bar_tabs.html' %} {% include 'navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.html' %} <!-- 👈 new code --> </nav></div>\nAnd similarly for mobile:\nwebapp/templates/navigation/mobile/mobile_nav_bar.htmlCopy<div class="mobile-nav-bar__container"> <nav id="mobile-nav-bar" class="mobile-nav-bar"> {% include 'navigation/mobile/mobile_nav_bar_brand.html' %} {% include 'navigation/mobile/menu_button.html' %} <div id="mobile-menu" class="mobile-nav-bar__menu mobile-nav-bar__menu--closed"> {% include 'navigation/mobile/mobile_nav_bar_tabs.html' %} <!-- 👈 new code --> </div> </nav></div>\nRegister the login view\nFor the user to be able to authenticate we need to define the login view as follows:\nauth/views.pyCopyfrom flask import Blueprint, redirect, session, url_for, current_app # 👈 Updated code\n# ... existing code\n# 👇 new code@auth_bp.route("/login")def login(): """ Redirects the user to the Auth0 Universal Login (https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) """ return oauth.auth0.authorize_redirect( redirect_uri=url_for("auth.callback", _external=True) )# 👆 new code# ... existing code\nWhen the user now presses the "Log In" button from the UI, the login view will redirect the user to the Auth0 Universal Login Page, where the user will be able to authenticate. After completion Auth0 will redirect the user to the callback endpoint completing the authentication process.\n<img alt="Universal Login Page" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:contain" class="markdown-image_image__5QLXt" sizes="100vw" srcSet="/resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, /resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="/resources/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F23aumh6u8s0i%2FePY1YZeYyxHlUK9lLkOhT%2Feffaa341f85844bb0ae593801cd04f27%2Funiversal-login-window.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/>\nCreate the Sign-Up Button\nUsers are able to log in, but they also need to be able to Sign Up.\nLet's open the webapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.html and add a new button:\nwebapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.htmlCopy<div class="nav-bar__buttons"> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.signup') }}" class="button__sign-up">Sign Up</a> <!-- 👈 new code --> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}" class="button__login" >Log In</a></div>\nThe same button needs to be added to the mobile view.\nRegister the signup view\nSimilarly to when we register the login view, we need to implement the signup view. The process only differs in that we will pass an additional parameter to Auth0, hinting the service to start the process on the Sign Up page.\nwebapp/views.pyCopy# ... existing code# 👇 new code@auth_bp.route("/signup")def signup(): """ Redirects the user to the Auth0 Universal Login (https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) """ return oauth.auth0.authorize_redirect( redirect_uri=url_for("auth.callback", _external=True), screen_hint="signup" )# 👆 new code# ... existing code\nWhen the user presses the "Sign Up" button will be redirected to a sign-up page instead of a login page.\nCreate the Log Out Button\nIt's time to let our users log out and exit their sessions.\nLet's open the webapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.html and add a new button:\nwebapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.htmlCopy<div class="nav-bar__buttons"> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.logout') }}" class="button__logout">Log Out</a> <!-- 👈 new code --> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.signup') }}" class="button__sign-up">Sign Up</a> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}" class="button__login" >Log In</a></div>\nThe same button needs to be added to the mobile view.\nRegister the logout view\nSame as with the previous steps we need to create a view and assign the view to the URL mappings.\nwebapp/views.pyCopy# ... existing code# 👇 new code@auth_bp.route("/logout")def logout(): """ Logs the user out of the session and from the Auth0 tenant """ session.clear() return redirect( "https://" + domain + "/v2/logout?" + urlencode( { "returnTo": url_for("webapp.home", _external=True), "client_id": client_id, }, quote_via=quote_plus, ) )# 👆 new code# ... existing code\nThe logout view code is somewhat different from login and signup as it doesn't depend on authlib, but rather it cleans the session to log out the user from the Flask application and it performs a redirect to Auth0 to log out the user from that side as well. If we don't perform the Auth0 log out, and the user presses the "Sign In" button again, it won't be necessary to provide any credentials, and the authentication flow will continue automatically with the Auth0 current authenticated user.\nRender Content Based on Authentication\nBecause you are storing the user's ID Token in the session, you'll use this value to decide whether a user is authenticated or not.\nRender authentication buttons conditionally\nLet's update the desktop view to conditionally render the buttons depending on the authentication status.\nwebapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.htmlCopy<div class="nav-bar__buttons"> {% if session.user %} <!-- 👈 new code --> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.logout') }}" class="button__logout">Log Out</a> {% else %} <!-- 👈 new code --> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.signup') }}" class="button__sign-up">Sign Up</a> <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}" class="button__login" >Log In</a> {% endif %} <!-- 👈 new code --></div>\nYou should apply these changes to the mobile view as well.\nRender navigation tabs conditionally\nSimilarly, only authenticated users are allowed to access the Protected and Admin views, so we hide the tabs from the nav bar appropriately.\nwebapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.htmlCopy{% macro tab(label='', path='') %}<a href="{{ path }}" class="nav-bar__tab {% if request.path == path %}nav-bar__tab--active{% endif %}"> {{ label }}</a>{% endmacro %}\n<div class="nav-bar__tabs"> {{ tab(label="Profile", path=url_for('webapp.profile')) }} {{ tab(label="Public", path=url_for('webapp.public')) }} {% if session.user %} <!-- 👈 new code --> {{ tab(label="Protected", path=url_for('webapp.protected')) }} {{ tab(label="Admin", path=url_for('webapp.admin')) }} {% endif %} <!-- 👈 new code --></div>\nYou should also apply these changes to the mobile view.\nSecure your Flask views\nNow that the navigation tabs will render conditionally, you'll need to make sure that only authenticated users have access to certain views.\nSecure the profile, protected and admin views\nTo protect our endpoints, we'll create a new decorator that validates the user session, and if no session is found it will redirect the users automatically to the login view. If, on the contrary, there's an existing session we'll continue with the default method.\nHead to the auth/decorators.py file and add the following code:\nauth/decorators.pyCopyfrom flask import redirect, session, url_forfrom functools import wraps\nclass AuthError(Exception): def __init__(self, error, status_code): self.error = error self.status_code = status_code\ndef requires_auth(f): """ Use on routes that require a valid session, otherwise it aborts with a 403 """ @wraps(f) def decorated(*args, **kwargs): if session.get('user') is None: return redirect(url_for('auth.login')) return f(*args, **kwargs) return decorated\nNow, adding one line of code is all that is needed now to require a user to be authenticated to access a view.\nwebapp/views.pyCopyfrom auth.decorators import requires_auth # 👈 new code\n# ... existing code@webapp_bp.route("/profile")@requires_auth # 👈 new codedef profile(request): template = loader.get_template('profile/index.html')# ... existing code\n@webapp_bp.route("/protected")@requires_auth # 👈 new codedef protected(request): template = loader.get_template('protected/index.html') # ... existing code\n@webapp_bp.route("/admin")@requires_auth # 👈 new codedef admin(request): template = loader.get_template('admin/index.html')\nRetrieve User Profile Information\nAfter a user successfully logs in, Auth0 sends an ID token to your Flask web application. Authentication systems, such as Auth0, use ID Tokens in token-based authentication to cache user profile information and provide it to a client application. The caching of ID tokens can improve the performance and responsiveness of your Flask application.\nBecause during the authentication routine we are storing the tokens and information processed by authlib, we have direct access to the user information from Auth0 in session.\nLet's process that information in a view to build the template that shows the user information on the screen.\nwebapp/views.pyCopy# ... existing code@webapp_bp.route("/profile")@requires_authdef profile(): """ Unprotected endpoint which displays your profile if you are logged in, otherwise it prompts the user to log in """ # 👇 updated code return render_template('profile.html', user_profile=session.get('user').get("userinfo")) # 👆 updated code# ... existing code\nIntegrate Your Flask Application with a Protected API Server\nThis section focuses on showing you how to get an access token in your Flask Web App and how to use it to make API calls to protected API endpoints.\nWhen you use Auth0, you delegate the authentication process to a centralized service. Auth0 provides you with functionality to log in and log out users from your Flask application. However, your application may need to access protected resources from an API.\nYou can also protect an API with Auth0. There are multiple API quickstarts to help you integrate Auth0 with your backend platform.\nWhen you use Auth0 to protect your API, you also delegate the authorization process to a centralized service that ensures only approved client applications can access protected resources on behalf of a user.\nRetrieve an Access Token from Auth0\nThanks to authlib there's not a lot we need to do as we are already storing the information processed by the library. That information not only contains user information, the ID Token, but also the access token needed by the application.\nTo retrieve the access token we are storing in session you can simply do:\naccess_token = request.session.get('user').get('access_token')\nHow can you make secure API calls from a Flask web app?\nInstead of creating an API from scratch to test the authentication and authorization flow between the client and the server, you can pair this client application with an API server that matches the technology stack you use at work. The Flask "Hello World" client application that you have been building up can interact with any of the "Hello World" API server samples from the Auth0 Developer Center.\nPick an API code sample in your preferred backend framework and language from the list below and follow the instructions on the code sample page to set it up. Once you complete the sample API server setup, please return to this page to learn how to integrate that API server with your Flask application.\nActix Web/Rust API:Authorization Code SampleCode sample of a simple Actix Web server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.ASP.NET Core Code Sample:Web API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple ASP.NET Core server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.ASP.NET Core v5 Code Sample:Web API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple ASP.NET Core v5.0 server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Django/Python API:Authorization Code SampleCode sample of a simple Django server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Express.js Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple Express.js server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Express.js/TypeScript Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple Express.js server built with TypeScript that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.FastAPI/Python Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple FastAPI server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Flask/Python API:Authorization Code SampleCode sample of a simple Flask server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Laravel/PHP Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple Laravel server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Lumen Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple Lumen server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.NestJS Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple NestJS server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Phoenix/Elixir API:Authorization Code SampleCode sample of a simple Phoenix server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Ruby on Rails API:Authorization Code SampleCode sample of a simple Rails server that implements authorization using Auth0.Spring Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationJava code sample that implements token-based authorization in a Spring Web API server to protect API endpoints, using Spring Security.Spring Functional Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationJava code sample that implements token-based authorization in a Spring Web API server to protect API endpoints, following a functional approach.Spring WebFlux Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationJava code sample that implements token-based authorization in a Spring WebFlux API server to protect API endpoints, using Spring Security.Golang Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple Golang server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.Symfony Code Sample:Basic API AuthorizationCode sample of a simple Symfony server that implements token-based authorization using Auth0.\nCall a Protected API from your Flask Web App\nAdd external API config variables\nOnce you have set up the API server code sample, you should have created an Auth0 Audience value. Store that value in the following field so that you can use it throughout the instructions presented on this page easily:\nAuth0 Audience\nNow, open your .env file and add the following variables to it:\n.configCopy[AUTH0]CLIENT_ID=AUTH0-CLIENT-IDCLIENT_SECRET=AUTH0-CLIENT-SECRETDOMAIN=AUTH0-DOMAINAUDIENCE=AUTH0-AUDIENCE\n[WEBAPP]SECRET_KEY=API_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6060\nYou are using AUTH0_AUDIENCE to add the value of your Auth0 API Audience so that your Flask web client application can request resources from the API that such audience value represents.\nLet's understand better what the AUTH0_AUDIENCE and API_SERVER_URL values represent.\nThe API_SERVER_URL is the URL where your sample API server listens for requests. In production, you'll change this value to the URL of your live server.\nYour Flask application must pass an Access Token when it calls a target API to access protected resources. You can request an access token in a format that the API can verify by passing the audience during the authentication request in your login view.\nThe value of the Auth0 Audience must be the same for both the Flask web client application and the API server you decided to set up.\nWhy is the Auth0 Audience value the same for both apps? Auth0 uses the value of the audience proprierty to determine which resource server (API) the user is authorizing your Flask application to access. It's like a phone number. You want to ensure that your Flask application "texts the right API".\nNext, as already mentioned, we need to pass the audience value during the login and signup requests.\nauth/views.pyCopy# ... existing code@auth_bp.route("/login")def login(): """ Redirects the user to the Auth0 Universal Login (https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) """ return oauth.auth0.authorize_redirect( redirect_uri=url_for("auth.callback", _external=True), audience=auth0_config["AUDIENCE"] # 👈 new code )\n@auth_bp.route("/signup")def signup(): """ Redirects the user to the Auth0 Universal Login (https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) """ return oauth.auth0.authorize_redirect( redirect_uri=url_for("auth.callback", _external=True), screen_hint="signup", audience=auth0_config["AUDIENCE"] # 👈 new code )# ... existing code\nUpdate the message service to call an external API\nUntil now, the message service would have "hardcoded" message values for each of the three type of messages (public, protected, and admin).\nNow you'll update the service to communicate with an external API.\nThe changes include removing the text messages for API calls, and the provision of an access token during those calls.\nCompletely replace the message_service.py file with the new content below:\nservices/message_serviceCopyimport requests\nfrom config import config\ndef make_request(path, access_token=None): url = '{}{}'.format(config["WEBAPP"]["API_SERVER_URL"], path) if access_token is None: headers = {} else: headers = { 'authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(access_token) } r = requests.get(url, headers=headers) return r.json()\nclass MessageService: def public_message(self): return make_request('/api/messages/public') def protected_message(self, access_token: str): return make_request('/api/messages/protected', access_token) def admin_message(self, access_token: str): return make_request('/api/messages/admin', access_token)\nThe library requests handles most of the load in the code above, we simply specify the URLs we want to target and wether we have or not an access token for the call.\nNote that the public endpoint does not require an access token to function, and thus it should not be a parameter in the function.\nSince your changes now affected the signatures of the functions protected_message and admin_message to expect a parameter access_token we need to provide it during their usage.\nHead on to views.py to fix those calls.\nwebapp/settings.pyCopy# ...existing code@webapp_bp.route("/protected")@requires_authdef protected(): """ Unprotected endpoint which displays your profile if you are logged in, otherwise it prompts the user to log in """ access_token = session.get('user').get('access_token') # 👈 new code return render_template('protected.html', message=MessageService().protected_message(access_token)) # 👈 updated code\n@webapp_bp.route("/admin")@requires_authdef admin(): """ Unprotected endpoint which displays your profile if you are logged in, otherwise it prompts the user to log in """ access_token = session.get('user').get('access_token') # 👈 new code return render_template('admin.html', message=MessageService().admin_message(access_token)) # 👈 updated code# ...existing code\nYou are getting the Access Token from the session, which you previously stored after the user authenticated in the callback method. Note you can safely use session.get('user') here because of the @requires_auth decorator, which guarantees the user has authenticated before accessing this view. Otherwise, the MessageService will pass a None Access Token to the API and you'll get a { message: Permission Denied } error from the External API.\nConclusion\nYou have implemented user authentication in Flask to identify your users, get user profile information, and control the content that your users can access by protecting views and API resources.\nThis guide covered the most common authentication use case for a Flask Web application: simple login and logout.

You'll learn how to integrate Auth0 with Flask to implement the following security features:This guide uses the Authlib library, which provides developers with a high-level API to handle OAuth and OpenID Connect servers from a low level specification implementation to integration with the major Python frameworks.How Does Auth0 Work?With the help of Auth0, you don't need to be an expert on identity protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, to understand how to secure your web application stack.You first integrate your Flask application with Auth0. Your application will then redirect users to an Auth0 customizable login page when they need to log in. Once your users log in successfully, Auth0 redirects them back to your Flask app, returning JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with their authentication and user information.Get the Starter ApplicationWe have created a starter project to help you learn Flask security concepts through hands-on practice. You can focus on building Flask views and services to secure your application.Start by cloning the web-app_flask_python_hello-world repository on its starter branch:Once you clone the repo, make web-app_flask_python_hello-world your current directory:Next, to work with the project we will create a virtual environment:Activate the virtual environment:Install the project dependencies as follows:This starter Flask project offers a functional application with views and services to hydrate the user interface. It is important to notice that the service implemented in the starter project simulates the external API by placing the responses directly on the code. Later on the guide, you'll integrate this Flask application with a real API server using a backend technology of your choice.Execute this command to run your Flask application on port 4040:You'll see the following output on the command line:Now you should visit http://localhost:4040/ to access the running application.Configure Flask with Auth0Follow these steps to get started with the Auth0 Identity Platform quickly:Sign up and create an Auth0 applicationA free account also offers you:During the sign-up process, you create something called an Auth0 Tenant, representing the product or service to which you are adding authentication.Once you sign in, Auth0 takes you to the Dashboard. In the left sidebar menu, click on "Applications".Then, click the "Create Application" button. A modal opens up with a form to provide a name for the application and choose its type. Use the following values:Click the "Create" button to complete the process. Your Auth0 application page loads up.In the next step, you'll learn how to help Flask and Auth0 communicate.What's the relationship between Auth0 Tenants and Auth0 Applications?Let's say that you have a photo-sharing Flask app called "Flasktagram". You then would create an Auth0 tenant called flasktagram. From a customer perspective, Flasktagram is that customer's product or service.Now, say that Flasktagram is available on three platforms: web as a single-page application and Android and iOS as a native mobile application. If each platform needs authentication, you need to create three Auth0 applications to provide the product with everything it needs to authenticate users through that platform.Flasktagram users belong to the Auth0 Flasktagram tenant, which shares them across its Auth0 applications.Create a communication bridge between Flask and Auth0When using the Auth0 Identity Platform, you don't have to build login forms. Auth0 offers a Universal Login Page to reduce the overhead of adding and managing authentication.How does Universal Login work?Your Flask application will redirect users to Auth0 whenever they trigger an authentication request. Auth0 will present them with a login page. Once they log in, Auth0 will redirect them back to your Flask application. For that redirection to happen securely, you must specify in your Auth0 Application Settings the URLs to which Auth0 can redirect users once it authenticates them.As such, click on the "Settings" tab of your Auth0 Application page, locate the "Application URIs" section, and fill in the following values:The above value is the URL that Auth0 can use to redirect your users after they successfully log in.The above value is the URL that Auth0 can use to redirect your users after they log out.Scroll down and click the "Save Changes" button.Do not close this page yet. You'll need some of its information in the next section.Add the Auth0 configuration variables to FlaskFrom the Auth0 Application Settings page, you need the Auth0 Domain and Client ID values to allow your Flask application to use the communication bridge you created.What exactly is an Auth0 Domain, an Auth0 Client ID and a Auth0 Client Secret?DomainWhen you created a new Auth0 account, Auth0 asked you to pick a name for your tenant. This name, appended with auth0.com, is your Auth0 Domain. It's the base URL that you will use to access the Auth0 APIs and the URL where you'll redirect users to log in.Client IDEach application is assigned a Client ID upon creation, which is an alphanumeric string, and it's the unique identifier for your application (such as q8fij2iug0CmgPLfTfG1tZGdTQyGaTUA). You cannot modify the Client ID. You will use the Client ID to identify the Auth0 Application to which the Flask application needs to connect.Warning: Another critical piece of information present in the "Settings" is the Client Secret. This secret protects your resources by only granting tokens to requestors if they're authorized. Think of it as your application's password, which must be kept confidential at all times. If anyone gains access to your Client Secret, they can impersonate your application and access protected resources.Head back to your Auth0 application page and click on the "Settings" tab.Locate the "Basic Information" section and follow these steps to get the Auth0 Domain, Auth0 Client ID, and Auth0 Client Secret values:When you enter a value in the input fields present on this page, any code snippet that uses such value updates to reflect it. Using the input fields makes it easy to copy and paste code as you follow along.As such, enter the "Domain" and "Client ID" values in the following fields to set up your Flask application in the next section:These variables let your Flask application identify as an authorized party to interact with the Auth0 authentication server.Now, create a new .config file under the Flask project directory as follows:Generate a string for SECRET_KEY using openssl rand -hex 32 from your shell.Head back to the "Settings" tab of your Auth0 application page in the Auth0 Dashboard to get the value for CLIENT_SECRET.Locate the "Client Secret" field, copy its value, and paste it as the CLIENT_SECRET configuration value in the .config file.Set Up Auth0To integrate your Flask application with Auth0 we'll use the Authlib library, which will handle all the OAuth and OpenID Connect for us.Next, let's install and integrate the library into the application.Install dependenciesThe starter branch already provides all the requirements you need to run this project, but make sure you have the following three libraries installed in your environment:You should now run pip install -r requirements.txt from your shell to make these dependencies available to your project.Initialize Auth0 configurationSo far our application registers one blueprint that registers the application views.To set up Auth0 we'll register a new blueprint that will take care of all auth views and logic.Start by creating a new directory at the root of your project named auth and add the following empty files inside of that directory:Now we can start by setting up authlib and register a new Auth0 OAuth provider by adding the following code to the auth/views.py file:Once we provide authlib with the Auth0 server details such as the client_id, client_secrent, scope, and server_metadata_url, the library is fully set up and we can start creating the views we need to handle the authentication requests with the Auth0 Authentication Server.You'll have to register the newly created blueprint to host all the authentication views as well as setting the application key we previously configured:What about using scopes?A property that you are configuring too for your OmniAuth-Auth0 strategy is the scope property. Here you're providing the OpenID Connect Scopes: openid profile email.openid: This scope informs the Auth0 Authorization Server that the Client is making an OpenID Connect (OIDC) request to verify the user's identity. OpenID Connect is an authentication protocol.profile: This scope value requests access to the user's default profile information, such as name, nickname, and picture.email: This scope value requests access to the email and email_verified information.The details of the OpenID Connect Scopes go into the ID Token. However, you can define custom API scopes to implement access control. You'll identify those custom scopes in the calls that your client applications make to that API. Auth0 includes API scopes in the access token as the scope claim value.Create the Auth0 callback viewWith the Auth0 configuration implemented you'll need to create a view to handle the authentication callback.After the user attempts to log in, either if it was successful or not, Auth0 will redirect them to the /callback endpoint and the router will call the view that matches with it in the application.In the callback view we authenticate the user coming from the request, store the user token in session and redirect the user to the profile endpoint.In case there's an error, we'll respond with a 400 error status code.Create the Login ButtonYou have created the callback view to handle a login flow in your app. Now you need to create a Login Button that will trigger the authentication flow.Let's create a new template that will handle the authentication buttons in the Nav Bar:Next, fill it up with the following content:We'll create an additional file for the mobile view:Next, fill it up with the following content:In both templates you are creating a button labeled "Log In". When the users click on this button they will make a GET request to /login endpoint.This endpoint is not defined yet, but you'll implement it in the next section.But before we do that, let's add the new buttons to the nav bar.For the Desktop template, make the following changes:And similarly for mobile:Register the login viewFor the user to be able to authenticate we need to define the login view as follows:When the user now presses the "Log In" button from the UI, the login view will redirect the user to the Auth0 Universal Login Page, where the user will be able to authenticate. After completion Auth0 will redirect the user to the callback endpoint completing the authentication process.Create the Sign-Up ButtonUsers are able to log in, but they also need to be able to Sign Up.Let's open the webapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.html and add a new button:The same button needs to be added to the mobile view.Register the signup viewSimilarly to when we register the login view, we need to implement the signup view. The process only differs in that we will pass an additional parameter to Auth0, hinting the service to start the process on the Sign Up page.When the user presses the "Sign Up" button will be redirected to a sign-up page instead of a login page.Create the Log Out ButtonIt's time to let our users log out and exit their sessions.Let's open the webapp/templates/navigation/desktop/nav_bar_buttons.html and add a new button:The same button needs to be added to the mobile view.Register the logout viewSame as with the previous steps we need to create a view and assign the view to the URL mappings.The logout view code is somewhat different from login and signup as it doesn't depend on authlib, but rather it cleans the session to log out the user from the Flask application and it performs a redirect to Auth0 to log out the user from that side as well. If we don't perform the Auth0 log out, and the user presses the "Sign In" button again, it won't be necessary to provide any credentials, and the authentication flow will continue automatically with the Auth0 current authenticated user.Render Content Based on AuthenticationBecause you are storing the user's ID Token in the session, you'll use this value to decide whether a user is authenticated or not.Render authentication buttons conditionallyLet's update the desktop view to conditionally render the buttons depending on the authentication status.You should apply these changes to the mobile view as well.Render navigation tabs conditionallySimilarly, only authenticated users are allowed to access the Protected and Admin views, so we hide the tabs from the nav bar appropriately.You should also apply these changes to the mobile view.Secure your Flask viewsNow that the navigation tabs will render conditionally, you'll need to make sure that only authenticated users have access to certain views.Secure the profile, protected and admin viewsTo protect our endpoints, we'll create a new decorator that validates the user session, and if no session is found it will redirect the users automatically to the login view. If, on the contrary, there's an existing session we'll continue with the default method.Head to the auth/decorators.py file and add the following code:Now, adding one line of code is all that is needed now to require a user to be authenticated to access a view.Retrieve User Profile InformationAfter a user successfully logs in, Auth0 sends an ID token to your Flask web application. Authentication systems, such as Auth0, use ID Tokens in token-based authentication to cache user profile information and provide it to a client application. The caching of ID tokens can improve the performance and responsiveness of your Flask application.Because during the authentication routine we are storing the tokens and information processed by authlib, we have direct access to the user information from Auth0 in session.Let's process that information in a view to build the template that shows the user information on the screen.Integrate Your Flask Application with a Protected API ServerThis section focuses on showing you how to get an access token in your Flask Web App and how to use it to make API calls to protected API endpoints.When you use Auth0, you delegate the authentication process to a centralized service. Auth0 provides you with functionality to log in and log out users from your Flask application. However, your application may need to access protected resources from an API.You can also protect an API with Auth0. There are multiple API quickstarts to help you integrate Auth0 with your backend platform.When you use Auth0 to protect your API, you also delegate the authorization process to a centralized service that ensures only approved client applications can access protected resources on behalf of a user.Retrieve an Access Token from Auth0Thanks to authlib there's not a lot we need to do as we are already storing the information processed by the library. That information not only contains user information, the ID Token, but also the access token needed by the application.To retrieve the access token we are storing in session you can simply do:How can you make secure API calls from a Flask web app?Instead of creating an API from scratch to test the authentication and authorization flow between the client and the server, you can pair this client application with an API server that matches the technology stack you use at work. The Flask "Hello World" client application that you have been building up can interact with any of the "Hello World" API server samples from the Auth0 Developer Center.Pick an API code sample in your preferred backend framework and language from the list below and follow the instructions on the code sample page to set it up. Once you complete the sample API server setup, please return to this page to learn how to integrate that API server with your Flask application.Call a Protected API from your Flask Web AppAdd external API config variablesOnce you have set up the API server code sample, you should have created an Auth0 Audience value. Store that value in the following field so that you can use it throughout the instructions presented on this page easily:Now, open your .env file and add the following variables to it:You are using AUTH0_AUDIENCE to add the value of your Auth0 API Audience so that your Flask web client application can request resources from the API that such audience value represents.Let's understand better what the AUTH0_AUDIENCE and API_SERVER_URL values represent.The API_SERVER_URL is the URL where your sample API server listens for requests. In production, you'll change this value to the URL of your live server.Your Flask application must pass an Access Token when it calls a target API to access protected resources. You can request an access token in a format that the API can verify by passing the audience during the authentication request in your login view.The value of the Auth0 Audience must be the same for both the Flask web client application and the API server you decided to set up.Why is the Auth0 Audience value the same for both apps? Auth0 uses the value of the audience proprierty to determine which resource server (API) the user is authorizing your Flask application to access. It's like a phone number. You want to ensure that your Flask application "texts the right API".Next, as already mentioned, we need to pass the audience value during the login and signup requests.Update the message service to call an external APIUntil now, the message service would have "hardcoded" message values for each of the three type of messages (public, protected, and admin).Now you'll update the service to communicate with an external API.The changes include removing the text messages for API calls, and the provision of an access token during those calls.Completely replace the message_service.py file with the new content below:The library requests handles most of the load in the code above, we simply specify the URLs we want to target and wether we have or not an access token for the call.Note that the public endpoint does not require an access token to function, and thus it should not be a parameter in the function.Since your changes now affected the signatures of the functions protected_message and admin_message to expect a parameter access_token we need to provide it during their usage.Head on to views.py to fix those calls.You are getting the Access Token from the session, which you previously stored after the user authenticated in the callback method. Note you can safely use session.get('user') here because of the @requires_auth decorator, which guarantees the user has authenticated before accessing this view. Otherwise, the MessageService will pass a None Access Token to the API and you'll get a { message: Permission Denied } error from the External API.ConclusionYou have implemented user authentication in Flask to identify your users, get user profile information, and control the content that your users can access by protecting views and API resources.This guide covered the most common authentication use case for a Flask Web application: simple login and logout.

One important aspect of web development is authentication, which ensures that only authorized users can access certain parts of an application. In this article, we'll take a look at how to implement authentication in Flask using Auth0.\\n\\nAuth0 is a powerful identity management platform that provides authentication and authorization as a service. It offers a variety of authentication methods, including social login, multi-factor authentication, and passwordless authentication. With Auth0, developers can quickly and easily add authentication to their applications without having to worry about the complexities of identity management.\\n\\nTo get started with Flask and Auth0, developers can follow the step-by-step guides provided in the Auth0 documentation. These guides cover everything from setting up an Auth0 account to integrating Auth0 with Flask.\\n\\nOne important aspect of authentication in Flask is the use of Flask-Login, a Flask extension that provides user session management. Flask-Login allows developers to easily manage user sessions and implement features such as remember me functionality and user authentication.\\n\\nHere's an example of how to use Flask-Login with Auth0:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\\nfrom flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_required, login_user, logout_user\\nfrom authlib.integrations.flask_client import OAuth\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\napp.secret_key = 'super secret key'\\n\\nlogin_manager = LoginManager()\\nlogin_manager.init_app(app)\\n\\noauth = OAuth(app)\\nauth0 = oauth.register(\\n    'auth0',\\n    client_id='<your-client-id>',\\n    client_secret='<your-client-secret>',\\n    api_base_url='https://<your-domain>.auth0.com',\\n    access_token_url='https://<your-domain>.auth0.com/oauth/token',\\n    authorize_url='https://<your-domain>.auth0.com/authorize',\\n    client_kwargs={\\n        'scope': 'openid profile email',\\n    },\\n)\\n\\nclass User(UserMixin):\\n    def __init__(self, user_id):\\n        self.id = user_id\\n\\n@login_manager.user_loader\\ndef load_user(user_id):\\n    return User(user_id)\\n\\n@app.route('/')\\ndef index():\\n    return 'Hello, World!'\\n\\n@app.route('/login')\\ndef login():\\n    return auth0.authorize_redirect(redirect_uri=url_for('callback', _external=True))\\n\\n@app.route('/callback')\\ndef callback():\\n    token = auth0.authorize_access_token()\\n    resp = auth0.get('userinfo')\\n    userinfo = resp.json()\\n\\n    user_id = userinfo['sub']\\n    user = User(user_id)\\n    login_user(user)\\n\\n    return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))\\n\\n@app.route('/dashboard')\\n@login_required\\ndef dashboard():\\n    return 'Welcome to the dashboard!'\\n\\n@app.route('/logout')\\n@login_required\\ndef logout():\\n    logout_user()\\n    return redirect(url_for('index'))\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    app.run()\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we're using the Flask-Login extension to manage user sessions. We're also using the Auth0 OAuth client to handle authentication. When a user logs in, we store their user ID in the session and redirect them to the dashboard. When a user logs out, we remove their user ID from the session and redirect them to the index page.\\n\\nOverall, Flask and Auth0 make it easy for developers to implement authentication in their web applications. With the help of Flask-Login and the Auth0 platform, developers can quickly and easily add authentication to their applications without having to worry about the complexities of identity management."}

The TLDR is that PostgresML is more opinionated, more scalable, more functional and several times faster than MindsDB. On the other hand, MindsDB is 5 times more mature than PostgresML according to age and GitHub Stars. What are the important factors?\nWe're occasionally asked what the difference is between PostgresML and MindsDB. We'd like to answer that question at length, and let you decide if the reasoning is fair.\nAt a glance\nBoth projects are Open Source, although PostgresML allows for more permissive use with the MIT license, compared to the GPL-3.0 license used by MindsDB. PostgresML is also a significantly newer project, with the first commit in 2022, compared to MindsDB which has been around since 2017, but one of the first hints at the real differences between the two projects is the choice of programming languages. MindsDB is implemented in Python, while PostgresML is implemented with Rust. I say in Python, because it's a language with a runtime, and with Rust, because it's a language with a compiler that does not require a Runtime. We'll see how this difference in implementation languages leads to different outcomes.\nMindsDB\nPostgresML\nAge\n5 years\n1 year\nLicense\nGPL-3.0\nMIT\nLanguage\nPython\nRust\nAlgorithms\nBoth Projects integrate several dozen machine learning algorithms, including the latest LLMs from Hugging Face.\nMindsDB\nPostgresML\nClassification\n✅\n✅\nRegression\n✅\n✅\nTime Series\n✅\n✅\nLLM Support\n✅\n✅\nEmbeddings\n-\n✅\nVector Support\n-\n✅\nFull Text Search\n-\n✅\nGeospatial Search\n-\n✅\nBoth MindsDB and PostgresML support many classical machine learning algorithms to do classification and regression. They are both able to load the latest LLMs some models from Hugging Face, supported by underlying implementations in libtorch. I had to cross that out after exploring all the caveats in the MindsDB implementations. PostgresML supports the models released immediately as long as underlying dependencies are met. MindsDB has to release an update to support any new models, and their current model support is extremely limited. New algorithms, tasks, and models are constantly released, so it's worth checking the documentation for the latest list.\nAnother difference is that PostgresML also supports embedding models, and closely integrates them with vector search inside the database, which is well beyond the scope of MindsDB, since it's not a database at all. PostgresML has direct access to all the functionality provided by other Postgres extensions, like vector indexes from pgvector to perform efficient KNN & ANN vector recall, or PostGIS for geospatial information as well as built in full text search. Multiple algorithms and extensions can be combined in compound queries to build state-of-the-art systems, like search and recommendations or fraud detection that generate an end to end result with a single query, something that might take a dozen different machine learning models and microservices in a more traditional architecture.\nArchitecture\nThe architectural implementations for these projects is significantly different. PostgresML takes a data centric approach with Postgres as the provider for both storage and compute. To provide horizontal scalability for inference, the PostgresML team has also created PgCat to distribute workloads across many Postgres databases. On the other hand, MindsDB takes a service oriented approach that connects to various databases over the network.\nMindsDB\nPostgresML\nData Access\nOver the wire\nIn process\nMulti Process\n✅\n✅\nDatabase\n-\n✅\nReplication\n-\n✅\nSharding\n-\n✅\nCloud Hosting\n✅\n✅\nOn Premise\n✅\n✅\nWeb UI\n✅\n✅\nThe difference in architecture leads to different tradeoffs and challenges. There are already hundreds of ways to get data into and out of a Postgres database, from just about every other service, language and platform that makes PostgresML highly compatible with other application workflows. On the other hand, the MindsDB Python service accepts connections from specifically supported clients like psql and provides a pseudo-SQL interface to the functionality. The service will parse incoming MindsDB commands that look similar to SQL (but are not), for tasks like configuring database connections, or doing actual machine learning. These commands typically have what looks like a sub-select, that will actually fetch data over the wire from configured databases for Machine Learning training and inference.\nMindsDB is actually a pretty standard Python microservice based architecture that separates data from compute over the wire, just with an SQL like API, instead of gRPC or REST. MindsDB isn't actually a DB at all, but rather an ML service with adapters for just about every database that Python can connect to.\nOn the other hand, PostgresML runs ML algorithms inside the database itself. It shares memory with the database, and can access data directly, using pointers to avoid the serialization and networking overhead that frequently dominates data hungry machine learning applications. Rust is an important language choice for PostgresML because its memory safety simplifies the effort required to achieve stability along with performance in a large and complex memory space. The "tradeoff", is that it requires a Postgres database to actually host the data it operates on.\nIn addition to the extension, PostgresML relies on PgCat to scale Postgres clusters horizontally using both sharding and replication strategies to provide both scalable compute and storage. Scaling a low latency and high availability feature store is often the most difficult operational challenge for Machine Learning applications. That's the primary driver of PostgresML's architectural choices. MindsDB leaves those issues as an exercise for the adopter, while also introducing a new single service bottleneck for ML compute implemented in Python.\nBenchmarks\nIf you missed our previous article benchmarking PostgresML vs Python Microservices, spoiler alert, PostgresML is between 8-40x faster than Python microservice architectures that do the same thing, even if they use "specialized" in memory databases like Redis. The network transit cost as well as data serialization is a major cost for data hungry machine learning algorithms. Since MindsDB doesn't actually provide a DB, we'll create a synthetic benchmark that doesn't use stored data in a database (even though that's the whole point of SQL ML, right?). This will negate the network serialization and transit costs a MindsDB service would typically occur, and highlight the performance differences between Python and Rust implementations.\nPostgresML\nWe'll connect to our Postgres server running locally: content_copy link edit psql postgres://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432\nFor both implementations, we can just pass in our data as part of the query for an apples to apples performance comparison.\nPostgresML adds the pgml.transform function, that takes an array of inputs to transform, given a task and model, without any setup beyond installing the extension. Let's see how long it takes to run a sentiment analysis model on a single sentence: content_copy link edit SELECT pgml.transform( inputs => ARRAY[ 'I am so excited to benchmark deep learning models in SQL. I can not wait to see the results!' ], task => '{ "task": "text-classification", "model": "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" }'::JSONB\n); timer 4769.337 ms\npositivity\n[{"label": "LABEL_2", "score": 0.990081250667572}]\nThe first time transform is run with a particular model name, it will download that pretrained transformer from HuggingFace, and load it into RAM, or VRAM if a GPU is available. In this case, that took about 5 seconds, but let's see how fast it is now that the model is cached. content_copy link edit SELECT pgml.transform( inputs => ARRAY[ 'I don''t really know if 5 seconds is fast or slow for deep learning. How much time is spent downloading vs running the model?' ], task => '{ "task": "text-classification", "model": "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" }'::JSONB\n); timer 45.094 ms\ntransform\n[{"label": "LABEL_1", "score": 0.49658918380737305}]\n45ms is below the level of human perception, so we could use a deep learning model like this to build an interactive application that feels instantaneous to our users. It's worth noting that PostgresML will automatically use a GPU if it's available. This benchmark machine includes an NVIDIA RTX 3090. We can also check the speed on CPU only, by setting the device argument to cpu: content_copy link edit SELECT pgml.transform( inputs => ARRAY[ 'Are GPUs really worth it? Sometimes they are more expensive than the rest of the computer combined.' ], task => '{ "task": "text-classification", "model": "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment", "device": "cpu" }'::JSONB\n); timer 165.036 ms\ntransform\n[{"label": "LABEL_0", "score": 0.7333963513374329}]\nThe GPU is able to run this model about 4x faster than the i9-13900K with 24 cores.\nModel Outputs\nYou might have noticed that the inputs the model was analyzing got less positive over time, and the model moved from LABEL_2 to LABEL_1 to LABEL_0. Some models use more descriptive outputs, but in this case I had to look at the README to see what the labels represent.\nLabels:\n0 -> Negative\n1 -> Neutral\n2 -> Positive\nIt looks like this model did correctly pick up on the decreasing enthusiasm in the text, so not only is it relatively fast on a GPU, it's usefully accurate. Another thing to consider when it comes to model quality is that this model was trained on tweets, and these inputs were chosen to be about as long and complex as a tweet. It's not always clear how well a model will generalize to novel looking inputs, so it's always important to do a little reading about a model when you're looking for ways to test and improve the quality of it's output.\nMindsDB\nMindsDB requires a bit more setup than just the database, but I'm running it on the same machine with the latest version. I'll also use the same model, so we can compare apples to apples. content_copy link edit python -m mindsdb --api postgres\nThen we can connect to this Python service with our Postgres client: content_copy link edit psql postgres://mindsdb:123@127.0.0.1:55432\nAnd turn timing on to see how long it takes to run the same query: content_copy link edit \\timing on\nAnd now we can issue some MindsDB pseudo sql: content_copy link edit CREATE MODEL mindsdb.sentiment_classifier\nPREDICT sentiment\nUSING engine = 'huggingface', task = 'text-classification', model_name = 'cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment', input_column = 'text', labels = ['negativ', 'neutral', 'positive']; timer 277.722 ms\nThis kicked off a background job in the Python service to download the model and set it up, which took about 4 seconds judging from the logs, but I don't have an exact time for exactly when the model became "status: complete" and was ready to handle queries.\nNow we can write a query that will make a prediction similar to PostgresML, using the same Huggingface model. content_copy link edit SELECT *\nFROM mindsdb.sentiment_classifier\nWHERE text = 'I am so excited to benchmark deep learning models in SQL. I can not wait to see the results!' timer 741.650 ms\nsentiment\nsentiment_explain\ntext\npositive\n{"positive": 0.990081250667572, "neutral": 0.008058485575020313, "negativ": 0.0018602772615849972}\nI am so excited to benchmark deep learning models in SQL. I can not wait to see the results!\nSince we've provided the MindsDB model with more human-readable labels, they're reusing those (including the negativ typo), and returning all three scores along with the input by default. However, this seems to be a bit slower than anything we've seen so far. Let's try to speed it up by only returning the label without the full sentiment_explain. content_copy link edit SELECT sentiment\nFROM mindsdb.sentiment_classifier\nWHERE text = 'I am so excited to benchmark deep learning models in SQL. I can not wait to see the results!' timer 841.936 ms\nsentiment\npositive\nIt's not the sentiment_explain that's slowing it down. I spent several hours of debugging, and learned a lot more about the internal Python service architecture. I've confirmed that even though inside the Python service, torch.cuda.is_available() returns True when the service starts, I never see a Python process use the GPU with nvidia-smi. MindsDB also claims to run on GPU, but I haven't been able to find any documentation, or indication in the code why it doesn't "just work". I'm stumped on this front, but I think it's fair to assume this is a pure CPU benchmark.\nThe other thing I learned trying to get this working is that MindsDB isn't just a single Python process. Python famously has a GIL that will impair parallelism, so the MindsDB team has cleverly built a service that can run multiple Python processes in parallel. This is great for scaling out, but it means that our query is serialized to JSON and sent to a worker, and then the worker actually runs the model and sends the results back to the parent, again as JSON, which as far as I can tell is where the 5x slow-down is happening.\nResults\nPostgresML is the clear winner in terms of performance. It seems to me that it currently also support more models with a looser function API than the pseudo SQL required to create a MindsDB model. You'll notice the output structure for models on HuggingFace can very widely. I tried several not listed in the MindsDB documentation, but received errors on creation. PostgresML just returns the models output without restructuring, so it's able to handle more discrepancies, although that does leave it up to the end user to sort out how to use models.\ntask\nmodel\nMindsDB\nPostgresML CPU\nPostgresML GPU\ntext-classification\ncardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment\n741\n165\n45\ntranslation_en_to_es\nt5-base\n1573\n1148\n294\nsummarization\nsshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6\n4289\n3450\n479\nThere is a general trend, the larger and slower the model is, the more work is spent inside libtorch, the less the performance of the rest matters, but for interactive models and use cases there is a significant difference. We've tried to cover the most generous use case we could between these two. If we were to compare XGBoost or other classical algorithms, that can have sub millisecond prediction times in PostgresML, the 20ms Python service overhead of MindsDB just to parse the incoming query would be hundreds of times slower.\nClouds\nSetting these services up is a bit of work, even for someone heavily involved in the day-to-day machine learning mayhem. Managing machine learning services and databases at scale requires a significant investment over time. Both services are available in the cloud, so let's see how they compare on that front as well.\nMindsDB is available on the AWS marketplace on top of your own hardware instances. You can scale it out and configure your data sources through their Web UI, very similar to the local installation, but you'll also need to figure out your data sources and how to scale them for machine learning workloads. Good luck!\nPostgresML is available as a fully managed database service, that includes the storage, backups, metrics, and scalability through PgCat that large ML deployments need. End-to-end machine learning is rarely just about running the models, and often more about scaling the data pipelines and managing the data infrastructure around them, so in this case PostgresML also provides a large service advantage, whereas with MindsDB, you'll still need to figure out your cloud data storage solution independently.

PostgresML 	2023-06-08	{"title":"MindsDB vs PostgresML: A Comparison of SQL-based Machine Learning Tools","article":"\\nMachine learning has become an integral part of data-driven decision making. With the rise of big data, it has become increasingly important to have tools that can handle large datasets and provide insights into the data. SQL databases have been a popular choice for storing and managing data, and there are several tools available that allow for machine learning to be performed directly within the database. In this article, we will compare two such tools: MindsDB and PostgresML.\\n\\nMindsDB\\nMindsDB is an open-source, SQL-based machine learning tool that allows developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models directly within their SQL database. MindsDB provides a simple interface that allows developers to specify the input and output columns, as well as the algorithm to be used for training the model. MindsDB supports a variety of algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.\\n\\nOne of the key features of MindsDB is its ability to automatically generate SQL queries based on the input data. This allows developers to easily integrate machine learning into their existing SQL queries without having to write any additional code. MindsDB also provides a REST API that allows developers to easily deploy their models to production.\\n\\nPostgresML\\nPostgresML is a SQL extension for PostgreSQL that provides machine learning capabilities. PostgresML allows developers to perform machine learning directly within the database, using SQL queries. PostgresML supports a variety of algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering.\\n\\nOne of the key features of PostgresML is its ability to use the database as a memory backend for machine learning. This allows for faster processing of large datasets, as the data can be stored directly in the database rather than being loaded into memory. PostgresML also provides a REST API that allows developers to easily deploy their models to production.\\n\\nComparison\\nBoth MindsDB and PostgresML provide SQL-based interfaces for machine learning, making it easy for developers to integrate machine learning into their existing workflows. However, there are some differences between the two tools.\\n\\nMindsDB is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal setup. It provides a simple interface that allows developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models with minimal effort. However, MindsDB does not provide as many advanced features as PostgresML.\\n\\nPostgresML, on the other hand, is designed to be more powerful and flexible. It provides a wide range of algorithms and allows developers to use the database as a memory backend for machine learning. This makes it well-suited for handling large datasets and performing complex machine learning tasks. However, PostgresML requires more setup and configuration than MindsDB.\\n\\nConclusion\\nBoth MindsDB and PostgresML provide powerful tools for performing machine learning within SQL databases. MindsDB is well-suited for developers who want a simple, easy-to-use tool for building and deploying machine learning models. PostgresML is better-suited for developers who need more advanced features and the ability to handle large datasets. Ultimately, the choice between the two tools will depend on the specific needs of the developer and the project at hand."}

And you are the senior developer who is teaching it - and making small incremental changes - and you will get better result as you prompt your way in a loop.\nNot no code, not low code, but some third thing.\nAllowing you to focus on sword fighting the big picture, while the AI does the button mashing coding for you.\nAdditionally, because the changes are small, incremental, and runs in a tight loop you are in full control of.

It'll be an interesting ride. Intro\nIf you've been following for me while, you may know by now that I'm a huge RxJS fan. And if you're not yet following me, it's a really good time to chill a bit and click that follow button before we start melting our brains 🧠🔥!\nSo far on dev.to, I've written 3 articles that are either heavily using or completely dedicated to RxJS:\nBrute-forcing an encrypted message from Enigma using the web worker API\nBuilding a reactive microwave for Ryan Cavanaugh with RxJs\nRxJS: Avoid an easy mistake when using startWith\nThis one is by far the most challenging of them all.\nRecently, we bought at work a Split flap display, also known as a "Solari board" or "Solari departure board". Split-flap counter - Fully 3d printable - YouTube Download:https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/69603-split-flap-counter-fully-printable youtube.com\nThe one we got is connected one where we can from an app set the text and it'll update IRL. It's funny to display all kind of important messages or statistics.\nI'm sure you know how mesmerizing it can be when all the letters are spinning and suddenly, they all stop, one after another, to display the final sentence. Wouldn't it be a cool challenge to build our own with RxJS? Rules of the challenge\nBefore we get started on this, lets define the expected result:\nReactive, reactive, reactive. No imperative programming. Everything should be managed through streams and not rely on external state. Of course it's fine for example to define the allowed letters in a global variable as a constant. But all the internal state of the app should be self contained in the streams\n20 letters in total on the display (easy to change anyway)\nCan display all the letters from A to Z, can have spaces between letters/words, and numbers from 0 to 9\nThe page should output the new state of the board whenever one letter is updated\nIf the text changes at any point in time, whether there's one ongoing already or if it's currently stopped, it shouldn't start from scratch. Just like in reality, it should continue from where it is currently and roll the letters to the new position\nExample of an expected output: Challenging you!\nYes you! I think it'd be a lot of fun if people reading this were to give it a go on their own and share how far they got.\nIn order to make this easier and not dwell on painful setup, I've created a Stackblitz template ready to go!\nIt contains some utility functions in utils.ts to manipulate the letters and the DOM, so that we remain focused on the streams.\nIf you decide to give this a go, fork the original Stackblitz or start from scratch if you prefer to. Feel free to modify anything from the template I've made. It's just here as a base to help, not here to hold you back.\nDon't forget to save your Stackblitz and share it as a comment. Even if you didn't manage to go all the way. Let's discuss the results! My solution\nIn programming, it's likely that there is more than one solution to achieve the same result. So keep in mind that this is my own approach and someone could come up with a different or even better solution.\nFrom now on, be aware that if you want to work on your own solution first, the following will is one possible answer, so it's really a big spoiler ⚠️.\nWithout further ado, let's jump straight in.\n"Here we gooooooooooooo".\nThe first thing I try doing when I have to build a feature that relies on observables, is picture in my head how that should all interact. Outter streams, inner streams. While it may be hard to represent visually, I visualise what I'm trying to build as a mix of marble diagrams and pipes that are all connected. I'll do my best to illustrate this but bear with me as this is no easy task.\nThis is as close as I can represent how things work in a visual way. Now let's dig into the code.\nAs a reminder, I'm not going to dive into the utils file I've created to manage letters and DOM manipulation. Feel free to take a look here for the whole implementation.\nNow, if we focus on the stream itself and put aside the update of the DOM for now, here's the core of our code:\nBefore we dig into the specifics, let's contemplate for a second the beauty and the power of RxJS.\nKeep in mind that the 14 lines of code above are capable of displaying a string just like a split-flap board, with animations (delay applied separately on each letter), keep the current state and if the text changes, start changing the letters from exactly where we are to the new position. It also manages correctly if we try to apply a text and change to a different one while the first one is still running, without resetting from scratch and picking up exactly where it is 🔥. RxJS is truly a thing of beauty.\nThe first thing we use is our input. It's a simple Subject that we can next into whenever we want. This could be bound to an input text for example.\nThen, we map that string to an input that'd match the board letters. Meaning, we want it to be an array of chars. One char for each entry of our display. For example, assuming the board supports 10 chars display for simplicity, if we pass 'HELLO' we'd get back ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O', '', '', '', '', ''].\nThen 🥁... We use a switchScan, which in all honnestly is the first time I could find a use case for it 🎉. As the name suggests, it's a mix of switch and scan:\nswitch means that we'll stop the inner stream if it's still running when the parent stream emits again\nscan is like a reduce. Meaning it take an accumulator, a current value, and the value you return from it becomes the new accumulator. Except that with reduce, it'll wait for the stream to complete before emitting and with scan it'll emit all the intermediate results. Here, switchScan means that our inner stream will be subscribed to, it'll be able to make multiple emissions that will become the new accumulator, and if the parent streams emits again (our input$$ subject), we stop changing the letters and start changing again to reach the new string just provided. Here, this operator is doing a fantastic job, it's the key to being able to stop an animation in the middle of it and continue from where the board is currently without resetting\nWe then have a combineLatest. In the diagram I drew above, the combineLatest is here to assemble all the streams (1 per letter) that are representend as vertical green arrows.\nThe build the array of streams that is passed to the combineLatest, we loop on the current letters we just received and for each, we compute all the letters in between what we currently have and the target letter for this tile. We then emit each of these intermediate letters that we'll need to go through by using from.\nFinally, with the from emitting all the intermediate letters, we use concatMap with a delay to make sure we emit the intermediate letters in the same order, with a delay in between each for simulate the animation.\nHere's the final version live in Stackblitz: Conclusion\nThis was a lot to take in, but was an interesting ride. Wasn't it?\nWhenever I get the chance to write RxJS code like this, it really reminds me why I love coding. When I found out about reactive programming about 6 years ago, it really blew my mind and I wanted to play with it till I'd be confortable enough to express myself with it, just like most developers are confortable expressing themselves with imperative code that we tend to learn first. Being able to write this now makes me really happy and I try to share that passion for reactive programming whenever possible.\nRxJS is a powerful tool and it takes time to learn. But once you manage to wrap your head around it, it's possible to handle really complex use case, in a relatively easy or at least readable way.\nI hope you enjoyed this article, if you did let me know with a reaction and eventually drop a comment. It's always nice to hear back from people who took the time to read a post 😄!

I'll do my best to illustrate this but bear with me as this is no easy task.This is as close as I can represent how things work in a visual way. Now let's dig into the code.As a reminder, I'm not going to dive into the utils file I've created to manage letters and DOM manipulation. Feel free to take a look here for the whole implementation.Now, if we focus on the stream itself and put aside the update of the DOM for now, here's the core of our code:Before we dig into the specifics, let's contemplate for a second the beauty and the power of RxJS.Keep in mind that the 14 lines of code above are capable of displaying a string just like a split-flap board, with animations (delay applied separately on each letter), keep the current state and if the text changes, start changing the letters from exactly where we are to the new position. It also manages correctly if we try to apply a text and change to a different one while the first one is still running, without resetting from scratch and picking up exactly where it is 🔥. RxJS is truly a thing of beauty.The first thing we use is our input. It's a simple Subject that we can next into whenever we want. This could be bound to an input text for example.Then, we map that string to an input that'd match the board letters. Meaning, we want it to be an array of chars. One char for each entry of our display. For example, assuming the board supports 10 chars display for simplicity, if we pass 'HELLO' we'd get back ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O', '', '', '', '', ''].Then 🥁... We use a switchScan, which in all honnestly is the first time I could find a use case for it 🎉. As the name suggests, it's a mix of switch and scan:We then have a combineLatest. In the diagram I drew above, the combineLatest is here to assemble all the streams (1 per letter) that are representend as vertical green arrows.The build the array of streams that is passed to the combineLatest, we loop on the current letters we just received and for each, we compute all the letters in between what we currently have and the target letter for this tile. We then emit each of these intermediate letters that we'll need to go through by using from.Finally, with the from emitting all the intermediate letters, we use concatMap with a delay to make sure we emit the intermediate letters in the same order, with a delay in between each for simulate the animation.Here's the final version live in Stackblitz: Conclusion\nThis was a lot to take in, but was an interesting ride. Wasn't it?Whenever I get the chance to write RxJS code like this, it really reminds me why I love coding. When I found out about reactive programming about 6 years ago, it really blew my mind and I wanted to play with it till I'd be confortable enough to express myself with it, just like most developers are confortable expressing themselves with imperative code that we tend to learn first. Being able to write this now makes me really happy and I try to share that passion for reactive programming whenever possible.RxJS is a powerful tool and it takes time to learn. But once you manage to wrap your head around it, it's possible to handle really complex use case, in a relatively easy or at least readable way.I hope you enjoyed this article, if you did let me know with a reaction and eventually drop a comment.

124	Must predictable state changes come at a high cost?	https://dev.to/licg9999/must-predictable-state-changes-come-at-a-high-cost-6cc	published	reddit	DEV Community CgL Posted on Jun 9 Must predictable state changes come at a high cost? #javascript #webdev #react #programming In state management of a frontend app, how to change states has been a vital problem since the early days. Today's widely accepted state management libraries have similar ways of getting states but different ways of changing states. For each of the libraries, one of the aspects developers care about most is how predictable state changes are.\nAfter I dealt with various state changes using various libraries, I realized one problem, predictability comes at a high cost in today's practice. Then, I started to ask the question of this article's title and to expect to explore a better practice, if possible.\nIt has been challenging for me to review the firmly accepted ideas in my head to find out what might not be good enough. And now, I'd like to share some of my thoughts with you to look deeper into state changes together in terms of predictability. What does it mean by predictable?\nFirst things first, predictable state changes mean state changes are easy to reason about. That is, in other words, what, why, when, and how states are changed are easy to understand.\nPreviously in MVC pattern, state changes are pretty hard to reason about. Every model hosts a state on its own and emits events of its state changes. When a model gets interested in a state change in some model, it subscribes to the event of that state change in that model. As a result, models get massively interconnected. Any state change may lead to "a tangled weave of data flow". The understanding of what, why, when, and how states are changed gets lost.\nWith this knowledge, let's check out how predictable are state changes in today's widely accepted state management libraries. Thinking that the battle of state management is more intense in React than in other frameworks, I'd take some of the typical state management libraries in React as the typical examples for the discussion here, which include Redux, Recoil, and MobX. (Please grab yourself some basic knowledge about the libraries if needed.)\nIn Redux, a procedure of state changes is a unidirectional data flow that actions are dispatched, reducers respond, then new states are produced. The single direction enforces, no matter whether an action is a plain action that only gets itself dispatched or a thunk action that gets more actions dispatched, once it finishes getting dispatched, no other actions will be dispatched anywhere downstream. Therefore, what, why, and when states are changed become easy to understand. As for how states are changed, if only plain actions are dispatched, it's determined by how responding reducers are defined. If some thunk actions are dispatched, it's determined by both how thunk actions are defined and how responding reducers are defined. Because reducers are pure functions modeled after math functions that don't have side effects, the major part of how states are changed becomes easy to understand. As a result, state changes in Redux become quite predictable.\nIn Recoil, a procedure of state changes is a combination of directly invoking state setters. The side effect of a state setter is restricted and doesn't get any other state setters invoked. Therefore, what, why, and when states are changed become easy to understand. As for how states are changed, it's determined by how procedures of invoking state setters are defined. Usually, procedures of invoking state setters can be encapsulated as hooks in Recoil, but hooks are not as easy to understand as pure functions because of side effects. So, state changes are less predictable in Recoil than in Redux.\nIn MobX, a procedure of state changes is a combination of directly assigning values to states that are marked observable. The side effect of an assignment is restricted and doesn't get any value assigned to other observable states. Therefore, what, why, and when states are changed become easy to understand. As for how states are changed, it's determined by how procedures of assigning values to observable states are defined. Usually, procedures of assigning values to observable states can be encapsulated as class methods in MobX, but class methods are not as easy to understand as pure functions because of side effects. So, state changes are less predictable in MobX than in Redux.\nTo sum up, Redux stands out in terms of predictability. The drawback of Redux\nThough, Redux is not perfect and has a drawback. If we take a closer look at its unidirectional data flow, event -> action -> reducer -> state, it's lengthy. No matter how simple a state change is, always at least one action and at least one reducer are involved. In comparison, a state change in either Recoil or MobX goes much easier. The lengthiness dramatically increases the cost of use in Redux.\nBut, is the lengthiness necessary for predictability? One thing I notice is, it is the single direction of the data flow making what, why, and when states are changed easy to understand. Another noticeable thing is, it is that reducers are pure functions making how states are changed easy to understand. So, the fact is, actions don't contribute to predictability. Then, the lengthiness can be resolved without affecting predictability.\nHowever, if so, why did actions come into being? I'd trace back Redux to its predecessor, Flux. In Flux, the unidirectional data flow is event -> action -> dispatcher -> reducer -> state. Although this is even lengthier because of the presence of the singleton dispatcher, every part of this still makes sense because the sub-flow, action -> dispatcher -> reducer, makes it doable for a reducer to wait for other reducers. As for what a reducer waits for other reducers to do, it's almost always for deriving data across states represented by reducers. But, when Redux inherits the core idea from Flux, selectors are added for deriving data, then the dispatcher is discarded so it's no longer doable for a reducer to wait for other reducers. As a result, actions no longer contribute to deriving data so become sort of pointless in terms of either functionality or predictability. Possibility of predictability at a low cost\nNow that the lengthiness is not necessary for predictability, predictable state changes don't have to come at a high cost. Thus, it would be possible to design a new state management library that achieves predictable state changes at a low cost. As the need of managing states is quite common, a new library of this kind would bring huge benefits to the future frontend development. Let's try exploring it as follows.\nFirst, I'd circle back a bit to Redux, Recoil, and MobX. In each of those libraries, what, why, and when states are changed are easy to understand because (1) state changes don't get other unexpected state changes triggered. In Redux, how states are changed is easy to understand because (2) it's mainly defined by reducers as pure functions. That is, these two points are just sufficient for predictable state changes. Anything else is not important in terms of predictability so can be simplified. Thus, one of the feasible ways to design a solution for the goal would be, state changes don't get other unexpected state changes triggered and meanwhile only involve reducers.\nThen, let's think about the form of a reducer for changing one state in this solution. On one hand, it accepts an old state and produces a new state. On the other hand, it accepts payloads directly as per events. So, what it looks like would be:\nfunction highlight(state: StateA): StateA { return { ...state, highlighted: true };\n}\nfunction setText(state: StateA, text: string): StateA { return { ...state, text };\n}\nfunction setHint(state: StateA, hint: string, hintColor: Color): StateA { return { ...state, hint, hintColor };\n} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nNext, let's think about the form of a reducer for changing multiple states in this solution. On one hand, it accepts multiple old states and produces multiple new states in the same order. On the other hand, it accepts payloads directly as per events. So, what it looks like would be:\nfunction setTextAndSwitchMode( [stateA, stateB]: [StateA, StateB], text: string, mode: Mode\n): [StateA, StateB] { return [ { ...stateA, text }, { ...stateB, mode }, ];\n} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nAfterward, let's see the behavior of the procedure involving these reducers to change states. The point here is, the procedure doesn't get other unexpected state changes triggered. As reducers are simply pure functions, what the procedure looks like would simply be:\nconst oldStateA = getState(keyOfStateA);\nconst newStateA = highlight(oldStateA);\nsetState(keyOfStateA, newStateA); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nWith the procedure encapsulated as a reusable function such as operate, the procedure can evolve into:\noperate(keyOfStateA, highlight);\noperate(keyOfStateA, setText, 'Lorem ipsum');\noperate(keyOfStateA, setHint, 'Ut enim', Color.GOLD);\noperate([keyOfStateA, keyOfStateB], setTextAndSwitchMode, 'Duis', Mode.QUIET); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nFurthermore, taking a closer look at the first param of a operate, it would be found that the role of a keyOf... is to identify a state. But declaring a series of unique strings for that is very costly. To lower this cost, one of the approaches is to make the most of something that already exists necessarily in state management, which, then, reminds me of state definitions.\nA state definition requires (1) a default state value and (2) a state type. And now, a state definition is going to be made able to (3) identify the state it defines. So, what would it look like? After thinking for a while, there, in JS, just happen to be a matching concept that can fulfill those three points all together, which is Plain Old JavaScript Object(POJO). A POJO as a state definition is able to host a default state value, declare a state type, and identify the state it defines at the same time. Hence, a procedure of state changes with POJOs as state definitions can further evolve into:\ninterface StateA { highlighted: boolean; text: string; hint: string; hintColor: Color;\n}\nconst defOfStateA: StateA = { highlighted: false, text: '', hint: '', hintColor: Color.BLACK,\n};\ninterface StateB { mode: Mode;\n}\nconst defOfStateB: StateB = { mode: Mode.NOISY,\n};\n// ...\noperate(defOfStateA, highlight);\noperate(defOfStateA, setText, 'Lorem ipsum');\noperate(defOfStateA, setHint, 'Ut enim', Color.GOLD);\noperate([defOfStateA, defOfStateB], setTextAndSwitchMode, 'Duis', Mode.QUIET); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nWith a solution like this, predictable state changes come at a low cost.\nTo make the solution complete, fundamental blocks of state management like getting states with or without selectors, subscribing to state changes, and integrating with frameworks are also needed.

56	How I Built a Modern 'Food Menu' Web App: From Tech Stack to Workflow	https://dev.to/livecycle/how-i-built-a-modern-food-menu-web-app-from-tech-stack-to-workflow-3iok	published	reddit	DEV Community Andrew Baisden for Livecycle Posted on Jun 7 How I Built a Modern 'Food Menu' Web App: From Tech Stack to Workflow #webdev #javascript #tutorial #react Introduction\nBuilding successful and efficient web apps needs two things: a strong technological foundation, and a solid approach to managing the work itself.\nMany development resources focus on one or the other. There are many good technical resources documenting how to build with vaious technologies and frameworks. There are also many good sources of insight for how to go about managing the development workflow across multiple stakeholders. But in this article, I will attempt to combine both into one and illustrate how I leveraged some great technologies to not only build a full-stack application, but also to manage the process and the pre-release workflow. Technologies I used\nWe'll be looking at how I worked with four main technologies: Node.js, GraphQL, Next.js, and Preevy. Each of these tools has been impactful for the broader web development community, and this is why I thought this was an interesting project and tech stack example to share with the community.\nNode.js, for example, provides developers with scalable and efficient backend development tools. Then there's GraphQL, a cutting-edge data query language that's changing the way we handle and modify data. Next.js is a sophisticated React framework that aids in the creation of highly performant and SEO-friendly front-end interfaces. Finally, Preevy is a tool for quickly and easily provisioning pre-release preview environments on your cloud (Amazon, Google or Microsoft). Preevy's shareable preview environments are a useful way for developers to share their latest code changes, get feedback and collaborate with other stakeholders before any code is merged to staging or production, enabling developers to enjoy a faster pre-release review workflow.\nOur summary of building a full-stack application will cover the following topics:\nBuilding the Node.js Express backend server\nBuilding the Next.js frontend server\nRunning the project in Docker\nProvisioning a shareable preview environment using Preevy Building a "food menu" app in public\nI've written this summary in the style of a "learning in public" diary. Hopefully this will make the content both interesting and accessible to a wide audience.\nThe app that we will be building will be for a food menu. Essentially there will be a Node.js backend with a GraphQL server that has an endpoint for our data which will be hard coded. And the Next.js frontend will connect to the Node.js backend to retrieve the data using GraphQL queries. Prerequisites\nNode.js\nNext.js\nDocker\nPreevy\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) and AWS CLI\nMake sure you have the prerequisites now let's get started! Building the Node.js Express backend server\nWe are going to start by creating our project locally on our computer. Navigate to a directory and run the commands below to setup our project and backend structure:\nmkdir menu-project\ncd menu-project\nmkdir server\ntouch docker-compose.yml\ncd server\nnpm init -y\nnpm i express express-graphql graphql cors\nnpm i -D dotenv nodemon\nmkdir data schema\ntouch .env Dockerfile index.js\ntouch data/menu.js schema/schema.js Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nNext, open the project in a code editor and then add the upcoming code to the correct files.\nPut this code in data/menu.js:\nconst bases = [ { id: '1', menuItem: 'Base', name: 'Egg Noodles', }, { id: '2', menuItem: 'Base', name: 'Whole-wheat Noodles', }, { id: '3', menuItem: 'Base', name: 'Rice Noodles', }, { id: '4', menuItem: 'Base', name: 'Udon Noodles', }, { id: '5', menuItem: 'Base', name: 'Jasmine Rice', }, { id: '6', menuItem: 'Base', name: 'Whole-grain Rice', },\n];\nconst vegetables = [ { id: '1', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Pak Choi', }, { id: '2', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Shiitake Mushrooms', }, { id: '3', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Champignon Mushrooms', }, { id: '4', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Mixed Peppers', }, { id: '5', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Broccoli', }, { id: '6', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Spinach', }, { id: '7', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Baby Corn', }, { id: '8', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Red Onion', }, { id: '9', menuItem: 'Vegetables', name: 'Bamboo Shoots', },\n];\nconst meats = [ { id: '1', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Chicken', }, { id: '2', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Chicken Katsu', }, { id: '3', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Beef', }, { id: '4', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Pulled Beef', }, { id: '5', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Bacon', }, { id: '6', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Pork', }, { id: '7', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Duck', }, { id: '8', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Prawns', }, { id: '9', menuItem: 'Meat', name: 'Tofu', },\n];\nconst sauces = [ { id: '1', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Sweet Teriyaki', }, { id: '2', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Sweet and Sour', }, { id: '3', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Garlic and black pepper', }, { id: '4', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Oyster Sauce', }, { id: '5', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Hot soybean sauce', }, { id: '6', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Yellow curry & coconut', }, { id: '7', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Peanut', }, { id: '8', menuItem: 'Sauce', name: 'Asian spiced red sauce', },\n];\nmodule.exports = { bases, vegetables, meats, sauces }; Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nThis code will go into schema/schema.js:\nconst { bases, vegetables, meats, sauces } = require('../data/menu');\nconst { GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLID, GraphQLString, GraphQLList, GraphQLSchema,\n} = require('graphql');\nconst BaseType = new GraphQLObjectType({ name: 'Base', fields: () => ({ id: { type: GraphQLID }, menuItem: { type: GraphQLString }, name: { type: GraphQLString }, }),\n});\nconst VegetableType = new GraphQLObjectType({ name: 'Vegetable', fields: () => ({ id: { type: GraphQLID }, menuItem: { type: GraphQLString }, name: { type: GraphQLString }, }),\n});\nconst MeatType = new GraphQLObjectType({ name: 'Meat', fields: () => ({ id: { type: GraphQLID }, menuItem: { type: GraphQLString }, name: { type: GraphQLString }, }),\n});\nconst SauceType = new GraphQLObjectType({ name: 'Sauce', fields: () => ({ id: { type: GraphQLID }, menuItem: { type: GraphQLString }, name: { type: GraphQLString }, }),\n});\nconst RootQuery = new GraphQLObjectType({ name: 'RootQueryType', fields: { bases: { type: new GraphQLList(BaseType), resolve(parent, args) { return bases; }, }, base: { type: BaseType, args: { id: { type: GraphQLID } }, resolve(parent, args) { return bases.find((base) => base.id === args.id); }, }, vegetables: { type: new GraphQLList(VegetableType), resolve(parent, args) { return vegetables; }, }, vegetable: { type: VegetableType, args: { id: { type: GraphQLID } }, resolve(parent, args) { return vegetables.find((vegetable) => vegetable.id === args.id); }, }, meats: { type: new GraphQLList(MeatType), resolve(parent, args) { return meats; }, }, meat: { type: MeatType, args: { id: { type: GraphQLID } }, resolve(parent, args) { return meats.find((meat) => meat.id === args.id); }, }, sauces: { type: new GraphQLList(SauceType), resolve(parent, args) { return sauces; }, }, sauce: { type: SauceType, args: { id: { type: GraphQLID } }, resolve(parent, args) { return sauces.find((sauce) => sauce.id === args.id); }, }, },\n});\nmodule.exports = new GraphQLSchema({ query: RootQuery,\n}); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nAnd here we have our .env file:\nNODE_ENV = "development"\nPORT = 8080 Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nLet's put this code in the Dockerfile:\nFROM node:18\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\nEXPOSE 8080\nCMD ["node", "index.js"] Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nAnd our index.js file gets this server code:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\nconst { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');\nconst schema = require('./schema/schema');\nconst app = express();\napp.use(cors());\napp.use( '/graphql', graphqlHTTP({ schema, graphiql: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development', })\n);\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 8080;\napp.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}, http://localhost:${port}`)\n); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nAnd lastly the docker-compose.yml file:\nversion: '3'\nservices: server: container_name: server build: context: ./server dockerfile: Dockerfile volumes: - ./server:/app ports: - '8080:8080' environment: - NODE_ENV=development client: container_name: client build: context: ./client dockerfile: Dockerfile volumes: - ./client/src:/app/src - ./client/public:/app/public restart: always ports: - 3000:3000 Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nWe just have to add these run scripts to the package.json file and we are good to go:]\n"scripts": {\n"start": "node index.js",\n"dev": "nodemon index.js"\n}, Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nNow with the backend part of our project setup just go into the root folder for the server and run the command below to start the backend server:\nnpm run start Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nJust go to http://localhost:8080/graphql to see your GraphQL API.\nNext up is the front end let's get to it. Building the Next.js frontend server\nChange your directory so that it is in the root of the menu-project folder and run the commands below to set up our project to use Next.js.\nnpx create-next-app client Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nComplete the setup I used this configuration here:\n✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … No / Yes\n✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … No / Yes\n✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? … No / Yes\n✔ Would you like to use src/ directory with this project? … No / Yes\n✔ Use App Router (recommended)? … No / Yes\n✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? … No / Yes\ncd into the client folder and run this command to install the packages we will need:\nnpm i @apollo/client graphql Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nWe need to create project files now so let's run this code to get them done:\ntouch Dockerfile\ncd src/app\nmkdir components queries utils\ntouch components/Bases.js components/Meats.js components/Sauces.js components/Vegetables.js\ntouch queries/clientQueries.js\ntouch utils/withApollo.js Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nAll that's left is to add the code to our files and we are done. So starting with components/Bases.js:\n'use client';\nimport { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';\nimport { GET_BASE } from '../queries/clientQueries';\nimport withApollo from '../utils/withApollo';\nconst Bases = () => { const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_BASE); if (loading) return <p>Loading bases...</p>; if (error) return <p>The food failed to load there is a problem</p>; return ( <div> {!loading && !error && ( <div className="base-box"> <div> <div className="cost-container"> <h1>01</h1> <p>$5.95 only one</p> </div> <h2> Chose <br /> your base </h2> {data.bases.map((bases) => ( <div key={bases.id}> <table> <tr> <td> {bases.id} {bases.name} </td> </tr> </table> </div> ))} </div> </div> )} </div> );\n};\nexport default withApollo(Bases); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nNext up is components/Meats.js:\n'use client';\nimport { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';\nimport { GET_MEAT } from '../queries/clientQueries';\nimport withApollo from '../utils/withApollo';\nconst Meats = () => { const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_MEAT); if (loading) return <p>Loading meats...</p>; if (error) return <p>The food failed to load there is a problem</p>; return ( <div> {!loading && !error && ( <div className="meat-box"> <div> <div className="cost-container"> <h1>03</h1> <p>$1.25 each 2 Max</p> </div> <h2> Choose <br /> your Meats </h2> {data.meats.map((meats) => ( <div key={meats.id}> <table> <tr> <td> {meats.id} {meats.name} </td> </tr> </table> </div> ))} </div> </div> )} </div> );\n};\nexport default withApollo(Meats); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nFollowing that add this code to components/Sauces.js:\n'use client';\nimport { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';\nimport { GET_SAUCE } from '../queries/clientQueries';\nimport withApollo from '../utils/withApollo';\nconst Sauces = () => { const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_SAUCE); if (loading) return <p>Loading sauces...</p>; if (error) return <p>The food failed to load there is a problem</p>; return ( <div> {!loading && !error && ( <div className="sauces-box"> <div> <div className="cost-container"> <h1>04</h1> <p>FREE</p> </div> <h2> Choose <br /> your Sauces </h2> {data.sauces.map((sauces) => ( <div key={sauces.id}> <table> <tr> <td> {sauces.id} {sauces.name} </td> </tr> </table> </div> ))} </div> </div> )} </div> );\n};\nexport default withApollo(Sauces); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nThis code will be going into components/Vegetables.js:\n'use client';\nimport { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';\nimport { GET_VEGETABLE } from '../queries/clientQueries';\nimport withApollo from '../utils/withApollo';\nconst Vegetables = () => { const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_VEGETABLE); if (loading) return <p>Loading vegetables...</p>; if (error) return <p>The food failed to load there is a problem</p>; return ( <div> {!loading && !error && ( <div className="vegetable-box"> <div> <div className="cost-container"> <h1>02</h1> <p>$1.25 each 4 Max</p> </div> <h2> Choose <br /> your Vegetables </h2> {data.vegetables.map((vegetables) => ( <div key={vegetables.id}> <table> <tr> <td> {vegetables.id} {vegetables.name} </td> </tr> </table> </div> ))} </div> </div> )} </div> );\n};\nexport default withApollo(Vegetables); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nNow over to the queries/clientQueries.js:\nimport { gql } from '@apollo/client';\nconst GET_BASE = gql` query getBase { bases { id name menuItem } }\n`;\nconst GET_VEGETABLE = gql` query getVegetable { vegetables { id name menuItem } }\n`;\nconst GET_MEAT = gql` query getMeat { meats { id name menuItem } }\n`;\nconst GET_SAUCE = gql` query getSauce { sauces { id name menuItem } }\n`;\nexport { GET_BASE, GET_VEGETABLE, GET_MEAT, GET_SAUCE }; Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nAlmost done this code is for utils/withApollo.js:\nimport { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nexport function initializeApollo(initialState = null) { const _apolloClient = new ApolloClient({ // Local GraphQL Endpoint uri: 'http://localhost:8080/graphql', // Add your Preevy GraphQL Endpoint // uri: 'https://your-backend-server-livecycle.run/graphql', cache: new InMemoryCache().restore(initialState || {}), }); return _apolloClient;\n}\nexport function useApollo(initialState) { const store = useMemo(() => initializeApollo(initialState), [initialState]); return store;\n}\nexport default function withApollo(PageComponent) { const WithApollo = ({ apolloClient, apolloState, ...pageProps }) => { const client = useApollo(apolloState); return ( <ApolloProvider client={client}> <PageComponent {...pageProps} /> </ApolloProvider> ); }; // On the server if (typeof window === 'undefined') { WithApollo.getInitialProps = async (ctx) => { const apolloClient = initializeApollo(); let pageProps = {}; if (PageComponent.getInitialProps) { pageProps = await PageComponent.getInitialProps(ctx); } if (ctx.res && ctx.res.finished) { // When redirecting, the response is finished. // No point in continuing to render return pageProps; } const apolloState = apolloClient.cache.extract(); return { ...pageProps, apolloState, }; }; } return WithApollo;\n} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nNext up our CSS in globals.css so replace all the code with this one:\n*,\n*::before,\n*::after { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box;\n}\nhtml { font-size: 16px;\n}\nheader h1 { text-align: center; color: #ffffff; font-size: 4rem; text-transform: uppercase;\n}\nh1 { color: #1c1917;\n}\nh2 { color: #1c1917; font-size: 1.4rem; text-transform: uppercase; border-top: 0.3rem solid black; border-bottom: 0.3rem solid black; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1rem 0 1rem 0;\n}\nbody { background: #374151;\n}\n.container { width: 100%; max-width: 90rem; margin: 2rem auto; display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; justify-content: space-around; background: #f9fafb; padding: 2rem;\n}\n.base-box,\n.vegetable-box,\n.meat-box,\n.sauces-box { background: #f43f5e; width: 20rem; height: auto; padding: 1rem; color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 2rem;\n}\n.cost-container { display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n.cost-container p { background: #eff6ff; padding: 0.2rem; color: #f43f5e; font-size: 1rem;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 800px) { .container { flex-flow: column; align-items: center; }\n} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nJust one more to go after this, so next is the page.js file and like before replace all the code with what we have here:\n'use client';\nimport Bases from './components/Bases';\nimport Vegetables from './components/Vegetables';\nimport Meats from './components/Meats';\nimport Sauces from './components/Sauces';\nexport default function Home() { return ( <> <header> <h1>Menu</h1> </header> <div className="container"> <Bases /> <Vegetables /> <Meats /> <Sauces /> </div> </> );\n} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nFinally, let's complete our project by putting this code in the Dockerfile in the client folder:\nFROM node:18-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\n# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager\nCOPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* ./\nRUN \\\nif [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn --frozen-lockfile; \\\nelif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; \\\nelif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then yarn global add pnpm && pnpm i; \\\n# Allow install without lockfile, so example works even without Node.js installed locally\nelse echo "Warning: Lockfile not found. It is recommended to commit lockfiles to version control." && yarn install; \\\nfi\nCOPY src ./src\nCOPY public ./public\nCOPY next.config.js .\n# Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage. Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry\n# Uncomment the following line to disable telemetry at run time\n# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1\n# Note: Don't expose ports here, Compose will handle that for us\n# Start Next.js in development mode based on the preferred package manager\nCMD \\\nif [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn dev; \\\nelif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm run dev; \\\nelif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then pnpm dev; \\\nelse yarn dev; \\\nfi Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nNow with the frontend and backend side of our project setup just go into the root folder for the client and run the command below to start the frontend server:\nnpm run dev Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nDouble-check that your backend server is still running and you should see the menu which is receiving data from the backend server.\nThe next section will show us how to run the app inside of a Docker container so on we go. Running the project in Docker\nGetting your application to run in Docker is super easy. First, make sure that Docker is running on your computer and that the other servers are not running because they will use the same ports. Then just ensure that you are inside the root folder for menu-project and then run the command docker-compose up. This will run the backend and frontend servers at the same time. Now just got to the same URLs as before for the server and client to see everything working.\nThe server is running on http://localhost:8080\nThe client is running on http://localhost:3000\nLastly, its time to deploy a preview environment using Preevy. By doing this we can share our work very easily with other people working on the project. They'll be able to see the latest version of the app with a single click, without needing to see how it looks or behaves in our development environment. This has already saved me hours of back and forth and I'm very happy to have found this tool and included it in my workflow. Creating a provision preview environment on Preevy\nFirst, read the documentation on Preevy and install it and then get ready to run the commands here to create a provisioning environment. Inside the root folder for menu-project run the following commands:\npreevy init\npreevy up --id 321 Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nYou must pass an --id flag with a string of numbers. I used 321 as an example which should work. The setup might take some time to complete because it has to create the backend and the front end on AWS. When it's complete you should get two URL's one for the server and one for the client see the example here:\nserver 8080 https://your-url-server.livecycle.run/\nclient 3000 https://your-url-client.livecycle.run/ Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nClicking on the links should take you to both servers running online. You will notice that the page is showing errors and not loading our data on the client link. That's because it's still set to http://localhost:8080/graphql in your code. Update the uri in the file client/src/app/utils/withApollo.js to your Preevy server GraphQL endpoint and then run the command preevy up --id 321 again to push the latest changes. Now the page should be showing data from our GraphQL API. Conclusion\nUltimately, the combination of tools like Node.js, GraphQL, Next.js is transforming the online development environment by bringing improved performance, flexibility, and data privacy compliance to the forefront. When these technologies are combined, they constitute a strong toolbox that enables developers to create scalable, efficient, and privacy-conscious apps.\nAnd tools like Preevy facilitate an only better developer experience by enabling developers lightning fast ways to securely deploy and share their work with others, so they can collect clear feedback and release higher-quality products.\nHopefully, you've found that this article presents a realistic strategy for exploiting the synergy of these technologies.\nHowever, because technology is always evolving, it is obligatory for every developer to constantly research and experiment with these tools. With this knowledge, you'll be well-equipped to take your web development talents to the next level, keeping on the cutting edge of technical innovation and creating apps that truly make a difference.

Update the uri in the file client/src/app/utils/withApollo.js to your Preevy server GraphQL endpoint and then run the command preevy up --id 321 again to push the latest changes. Now the page should be showing data from our GraphQL API. Conclusion\nUltimately, the combination of tools like Node.js, GraphQL, Next.js is transforming the online development environment by bringing improved performance, flexibility, and data privacy compliance to the forefront. When these technologies are combined, they constitute a strong toolbox that enables developers to create scalable, efficient, and privacy-conscious apps.And tools like Preevy facilitate an only better developer experience by enabling developers lightning fast ways to securely deploy and share their work with others, so they can collect clear feedback and release higher-quality products.Hopefully, you've found that this article presents a realistic strategy for exploiting the synergy of these technologies.However, because technology is always evolving, it is obligatory for every developer to constantly research and experiment with these tools. With this knowledge, you'll be well-equipped to take your web development talents to the next level, keeping on the cutting edge of technical innovation and creating apps that truly make a difference.

It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and has since been open-sourced. GraphQL allows developers to define the structure of their data and query it in a more efficient and flexible way than traditional REST APIs. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using GraphQL for web development.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of GraphQL is that it allows developers to fetch only the data they need. With traditional REST APIs, developers often have to make multiple requests to retrieve the data they need. This can lead to over-fetching, where unnecessary data is retrieved, or under-fetching, where multiple requests are needed to retrieve all the necessary data. With GraphQL, developers can specify exactly what data they need and receive it in a single request.\\n\\nAnother advantage of GraphQL is that it allows for a more flexible API. With REST APIs, the structure of the data is defined by the server. This can lead to issues when the client needs to retrieve data in a different format. With GraphQL, the client can define the structure of the data it needs, allowing for a more flexible API.\\n\\nGraphQL also provides a powerful tool for handling relationships between data. With traditional REST APIs, handling relationships between data can be complex and require multiple requests. With GraphQL, developers can easily query related data in a single request.\\n\\nIn addition to these benefits, GraphQL also provides a type system that allows for better documentation and tooling. With a type system, developers can easily understand the structure of the data and the available queries. This can lead to better collaboration between developers and improved code quality.\\n\\nTo illustrate the benefits of GraphQL, let's take a look at a simple example. Suppose we have a blog with posts and comments. With a traditional REST API, we might have to make multiple requests to retrieve all the necessary data. We might first request the list of posts, and then for each post, make a separate request to retrieve the comments. With GraphQL, we can specify exactly what data we need in a single request. We might request the list of posts and include the comments for each post in the same query.\\n\\n```\\nquery {\\n  posts {\\n    id\\n    title\\n    content\\n    comments {\\n      id\\n      text\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn conclusion, GraphQL provides many benefits for web development. It allows for more efficient and flexible data retrieval, easier handling of relationships between data, and better documentation and tooling. As the web development community continues to adopt GraphQL, it is important for developers to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices."}

64	“csinc”, the AArch64 instruction you didn’t know you wanted	https://danlark.org/2023/06/06/csinc-the-arm-instruction-you-didnt-know-you-wanted/	published	reddit	Experimental chill a random walk through Software Engineering “csinc”, the AArch64 instruction you didn’t know you wanted Posted byDanila KuteninJune 6, 2023June 6, 2023Posted inUncategorized After a long time of not publishing anything and being passive about doing any writing in this blog, I am coming back for … however many articles I can. Today I want to talk about an underrated feature of AArch64 ISA which is often overlooked but used by compilers a lot. It’s just a good and short story on what made Arm even better and more “CISCy” when it comes down to conditional moves. The story of csinc deserves an article like this.\nYou probably heard of cmov\nTraditionally, when you encounter conditional moves in literature, it is about x86 instruction cmov. It’s a nice feature and allows to accomplish better performance in low level optimization. Say, if you merge 2 arrays, you can compare numbers and choose the one depending on the value of compare instructions (more precisely, flags):\nwhile ((pos1 < size1) & (pos2 < size2)) { v1 = input1[pos1]; v2 = input2[pos2]; output_buffer[pos++] = (v1 <= v2) ? v1 : v2; pos1 = (v1 <= v2) ? pos1 + 1 : pos1; pos2 = (v1 >= v2) ? pos2 + 1 : pos2;\n}\ncmpl %r14d, %ebp # compare which one is smaller, set CF\nsetbe %bl # set CF to %bl if it's smaller\ncmovbl %ebp, %r14d # move ebp into r14d if flag CF was set\nIf branches are unpredictable, for instance, you merge 2 arrays of random integers, conditional move instructions bring significant speed-ups against branchy version because of removing the branch misprediction penalty. A lot was written about this in the Lemire’s blog. Much engineering has been done on this including Agner Fog, cmov vs branch profile guided optimizations. Conditional move instructions are a huge domain of modern software, pretty much anything you run likely have them.\nWhat about Arm?\nAArch64 is no exception in this area and has some conditional move instructions as well. The immediate equivalent, if you Google it, is csel which is translated like conditional select. There is almost no difference to cmov except you specify directly which condition you want to check and destination register (in cmov the destination is unchanged if condition is not met). To my eye it is a bit more intuitive to read:\ncsel Xd, Xn, Xm, cond\nWhen I was studying the structure of this instruction in the optimization guide, I noticed the family included different variations:\nI was intrigued by the existence of some other forms as this involves more opportunities for the compilers and engineers to write software. For example, csinc Xd, Xa, Xb, cond (conditional select increase) means that if the condition holds, Xd = Xb + 1, otherwise Xd = Xa. For example, in merging 2 arrays, the line:\npos1 = (v1 <= v2) ? pos1 + 1 : pos1;\ncan be compiled into:\ncsinc X0, X0, X0, #condition_of_v1_less_equal_v2\nwhere X0 is a register for pos1.\ncsneg, csinv are similar and represent conditional negations and inversions.\nFor example, clang recognizes this sequence, whereas GCC does not.\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/5cKG3vvKT\nWhere can this be useful otherwise?\nInterestingly enough, in compression! You might heard of Snappy, the old Google compression library which was surpassed by LZ4 many times. For x86, the difference in speed – even for the latest version of clang – is quite big. For example, on my server Intel Xeon 2.00GHz I have 2721MB/s of decompression for LZ4 and 2172MB/s for Snappy which is a 25% gap.\nFor Snappy to reach that level of decompression, engineers needed to write very subtle code to achieve cmov code generation:\n.gist table { margin-bottom: 0; } This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.

Loading the values first and then cmov has less // latency then cmov ip and then load. However clang would move the loads // in an optimization phase, volatile prevents this transformation. // Note that we have enough slop bytes (64) that the loads are always valid. size_t tag_literal = static_cast<const volatile uint8_t*>(ip)[1 + literal_len]; size_t tag_copy = static_cast<const volatile uint8_t*>(ip)[tag_type]; *tag = is_literal ? tag_literal : tag_copy; const uint8_t* ip_copy = ip + 1 + tag_type; const uint8_t* ip_literal = ip + 2 + literal_len; ip = is_literal ? ip_literal : ip_copy; #if defined(__GNUC__) && defined(__x86_64__) // TODO Clang is "optimizing" zero-extension (a totally free // operation) this means that after the cmov of tag, it emits another movzb // tag, byte(tag). It really matters as it's on the core chain. This dummy // asm, persuades clang to do the zero-extension at the load (it's automatic) // removing the expensive movzb. asm("" ::"r"(tag_copy)); #endif return tag_type; } view raw x86_snappy_cmov.cc hosted with ❤ by GitHub\nFor Arm, csinc instruction was used because of the nature of the format:\nShortly, last 2 bits of the byte that opens the block have the instruction on what to do and which memory to copy: 00 copies len-1 data. With careful optimization of conditional moves, we can save on adding this +1 back through csinc:\nhttps://gcc.godbolt.org/z/oPErYhz9b\nOn Google T2A instances I got 3048MB/s decompression for LZ4 and 2839MB/s which is only a 7% gap. If I enable LZ4_FAST_DEC_LOOP, I have 3233MB/s which still makes a 13% gap but not 25% as per x86 execution.\nIn conclusion, conditional select instructions for Arm deserve attention and awareness:\ncsel, csinc and others have same latency and throughput, meaning, they are as cheap as usual csel for almost all modern Arm processors including Apple M1, M2.\nCompilers do recognize them (in my experience, clang did better than GCC, see above), no need to do anything special, just be aware that some formats might work better for Arm than for x86.\nTo sum up, contrary to the belief of CISC vs RISC debate about x86 and Arm ISA, the latter has surprising features of conditional instructions which are more flexible than the traditionally discussed ones.\nYou can read more about this topic in other blogs, in Arm reference guide, Microsoft blog of AArch64 conditional execution.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...

Today I want to talk about an underrated feature of AArch64 ISA which is often overlooked but used by compilers a lot. It’s just a good and short story on what made Arm even better and more “CISCy” when it comes down to conditional moves. The story of csinc deserves an article like this.You probably heard of cmovTraditionally, when you encounter conditional moves in literature, it is about x86 instruction cmov. It’s a nice feature and allows to accomplish better performance in low level optimization. Say, if you merge 2 arrays, you can compare numbers and choose the one depending on the value of compare instructions (more precisely, flags):If branches are unpredictable, for instance, you merge 2 arrays of random integers, conditional move instructions bring significant speed-ups against branchy version because of removing the branch misprediction penalty. A lot was written about this in the Lemire’s blog. Much engineering has been done on this including Agner Fog, cmov vs branch profile guided optimizations. Conditional move instructions are a huge domain of modern software, pretty much anything you run likely have them.What about Arm?AArch64 is no exception in this area and has some conditional move instructions as well. The immediate equivalent, if you Google it, is csel which is translated like conditional select. There is almost no difference to cmov except you specify directly which condition you want to check and destination register (in cmov the destination is unchanged if condition is not met). To my eye it is a bit more intuitive to read:When I was studying the structure of this instruction in the optimization guide, I noticed the family included different variations:I was intrigued by the existence of some other forms as this involves more opportunities for the compilers and engineers to write software. For example, csinc Xd, Xa, Xb, cond (conditional select increase) means that if the condition holds, Xd = Xb + 1, otherwise Xd = Xa. For example, in merging 2 arrays, the line:can be compiled into:where X0 is a register for pos1.csneg, csinv are similar and represent conditional negations and inversions.For example, clang recognizes this sequence, whereas GCC does not.Where can this be useful otherwise?Interestingly enough, in compression! You might heard of Snappy, the old Google compression library which was surpassed by LZ4 many times. For x86, the difference in speed – even for the latest version of clang – is quite big. For example, on my server Intel Xeon 2.00GHz I have 2721MB/s of decompression for LZ4 and 2172MB/s for Snappy which is a 25% gap.For Snappy to reach that level of decompression, engineers needed to write very subtle code to achieve cmov code generation:For Arm, csinc instruction was used because of the nature of the format:Shortly, last 2 bits of the byte that opens the block have the instruction on what to do and which memory to copy: 00 copies len-1 data. With careful optimization of conditional moves, we can save on adding this +1 back through csinc:On Google T2A instances I got 3048MB/s decompression for LZ4 and 2839MB/s which is only a 7% gap. If I enable LZ4_FAST_DEC_LOOP, I have 3233MB/s which still makes a 13% gap but not 25% as per x86 execution.In conclusion, conditional select instructions for Arm deserve attention and awareness:To sum up, contrary to the belief of CISC vs RISC debate about x86 and Arm ISA, the latter has surprising features of conditional instructions which are more flexible than the traditionally discussed ones.You can read more about this topic in other blogs, in Arm reference guide, Microsoft blog of AArch64 conditional execution.Share this:Like this:RelatedPost navigation One thought on ““csinc”, the AArch64 instruction you didn’t know you wanted” I learned something today.LikeLiked by 1 personLeave a Reply Cancel replyFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

However, there's an underrated feature of AArch64 ISA that is often overlooked but used by compilers a lot - csinc. In this article, we'll explore the power of csinc and why it's a hidden gem for developers.\\n\\nFirst, let's take a step back and understand what conditional moves are. Conditional moves are instructions that allow you to conditionally set the value of a register based on a condition. This can be useful in low-level optimization, such as when merging two arrays. Traditionally, conditional moves are associated with the x86 instruction cmov.\\n\\nHowever, AArch64 ISA has its own version of conditional moves - csinc. What makes csinc unique is its ability to perform a conditional increment or decrement in a single instruction. This can be incredibly useful in situations where you need to increment or decrement a value based on a condition.\\n\\nLet's take a look at an example. Say we have a variable x and we want to increment it if y is greater than z. In C, we would write:\\n\\nif (y > z) {\\n    x++;\\n}\\n\\nIn AArch64 assembly, we can use csinc to achieve the same result:\\n\\ncsinc w0, w0, wzr, gt\\n\\nIn this instruction, w0 is the destination register, w0 is the source register, wzr is the zero register, and gt is the condition code. If the condition gt is true (y > z), then w0 is incremented. Otherwise, w0 remains unchanged.\\n\\nCsinc can also be used to perform a conditional decrement. For example, if we want to decrement x if y is less than z, we can use the following instruction:\\n\\ncsinc w0, w0, wzr, lt\\n\\nCsinc is not only useful for incrementing and decrementing values, but it can also be used to perform other operations based on a condition. For example, we can use csinc to perform a conditional move. Say we have two variables x and y, and we want to move the value of x into y if y is less than z. In AArch64 assembly, we can use the following instruction:\\n\\ncsinc x0, x1, x0, lt\\n\\nIn this instruction, x0 is the destination register, x1 is the source register, x0 is the value to be moved if the condition lt is true (y < z).\\n\\nCsinc may seem like a small feature, but it can have a big impact on performance. By allowing developers to perform conditional increments and decrements in a single instruction, csinc can help reduce the number of instructions needed to perform certain operations. This can lead to faster and more efficient code.\\n\\nIn conclusion, csinc is a hidden gem in AArch64 ISA that developers should be aware of. While it may not be as well-known as cmov, csinc's ability to perform conditional increments and decrements in a single instruction can be incredibly useful in low-level optimization. By taking advantage of csinc, developers can write faster and more efficient code."}

So it would be great if we could convert the above to something we're already used to. And we can, by using an array!Our reading process got shorter:I don't know about you, but this is way better!There's still something I don't like, though.The conditions on the left can become quite difficult to process. Mainly because we can have all kinds of operators in there: equals, booleans, negations, not equal, includes, doesn't include, etc. All these can come in different combinations, which makes it even harder.We could try using only the equality operator:But then the whole thing gets way too long.Ideally, the "if" part of our problem should be simpler and shorter!Consider this:If you read the above like "intent primary, disabled false, class bg-blue-700..etc" you are 100% correct; that's exactly what it means!The operator is always "equals" and we still kind of follow the if-then-else statement. If all key:value pairs before class are true, then the classes will apply. Even though the above, technically, is longer than our initial example, it's way easier to read!This is why I absolutely love the class-variance-authority library. I have no idea why it's named like that, but I love it!CVA (class-variance-authority)CVA is a small library, basically a function, that allows us to define variants for the element we want to style.A simple variant definition has a name and a list of possible values, each with a list of classes that should apply.The above basically translates to:A compound variant is an object who's key:value pairs represent a variant name and its value. This allows us to apply classes based on different combinations of variants.class represents the applied css classes and should never be used as a variant name.Putting everything together, here's how our initial example would look like using cva:Ugh, I can already see your face 😂;I'm sure a lot of you are a bit confused; like, hey, this looks like way too much work! You said you had like an 8-bit brain; what's with this long-ass definition???You are right; this seems quite complex and difficult to write. But trust me, once you try it, it will feel just like tailwind did the first time you used it; it will be weird, possibly a bit confusing, but you’ll grow to love it, and it will forever change the way you write dynamic classes in vue.If you enjoyed this post, do me a favor and subscribe to my YT channel!If you end up trying cva, I'm sure you'll love it, so make sure to star the library and share this blog post with the entire universe!	2023-06-06	{"title":"Simplifying Dynamic Classes in Vue with the class-variance-authority Library","article":"\\nVue is a popular JavaScript framework that allows developers to build dynamic user interfaces. However, working with dynamic classes in Vue can be a challenging task. The class-variance-authority library offers a solution to simplify this process.\\n\\nDynamic classes in Vue are used to apply different styles to an element based on certain conditions. For example, if a button is disabled, it should have a different style than when it is enabled. The traditional way of processing dynamic classes in Vue involves using multiple conditions, which can be difficult to process.\\n\\nThe class-variance-authority library simplifies this process by using an array to define the conditions. The conditions are written in a way that is similar to the \\"if-then-else\\" statement, making it easier for developers to understand.\\n\\nConsider the following example:\\n\\n```\\n<div :class=\\"[\\n  { 'bg-blue-700': primary && !disabled },\\n  { 'bg-gray-400': !primary && !disabled },\\n  { 'bg-gray-500': disabled }\\n]\\">\\n```\\n\\nThis code applies different background colors to the element based on the conditions. The first condition applies the \\"bg-blue-700\\" class if the button is primary and not disabled. The second condition applies the \\"bg-gray-400\\" class if the button is not primary and not disabled. The third condition applies the \\"bg-gray-500\\" class if the button is disabled.\\n\\nUsing the class-variance-authority library, the same code can be written in a simpler way:\\n\\n```\\n<div :class=\\"[\\n  { intent: primary, disabled: false, class: 'bg-blue-700' },\\n  { intent: !primary, disabled: false, class: 'bg-gray-400' },\\n  { disabled: true, class: 'bg-gray-500' }\\n]\\">\\n```\\n\\nThis code uses key-value pairs to define the conditions. The \\"intent\\" key represents the primary condition, the \\"disabled\\" key represents the disabled condition, and the \\"class\\" key represents the class to be applied. The operator used is always \\"equals\\", making it easier to read and understand.\\n\\nThe class-variance-authority library simplifies the process of working with dynamic classes in Vue, making it easier for developers to write and maintain code. By using key-value pairs to define the conditions, developers can write code that is easier to read and understand. This library is a great addition to any Vue project and is highly recommended for developers who want to simplify their code."}
112	Flattening ASTs (and Other Compiler Data Structures)	https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/flattening.html	published	reddit	 Adrian Sampson Flattening ASTs (and Other Compiler Data Structures)May 1, 2023Arenas, a.k.a. regions, are everywhere in modern language implementations.\nOne form of arenas is both super simple and surprisingly effective for compilers and compiler-like things.\nMaybe because of its simplicity, I haven’t seen the basic technique in many compiler courses—or anywhere else in a CS curriculum for that matter.\nThis post is an introduction to the idea and its many virtues.Arenas or regions mean many different things to different people, so I’m going to call the specific flavor I’m interested in here data structure flattening.\nFlattening uses an arena that only holds one type, so it’s actually just a plain array, and you can use array indices where you would otherwise need pointers.\nWe’ll focus here on flattening abstract syntax trees (ASTs), but the idea applies to any pointer-laden data structure.To learn about flattening, we’ll build a basic interpreter twice:\nfirst the normal way and then the flat way.\nFollow along with the code in this repository, where you can compare and contrast the two branches.\nThe key thing to notice is that the changes are pretty small,\nbut we’ll see that they make a microbenchmark go 2.4× faster.\nBesides performance, flattening also brings some ergonomics advantages that I’ll outline.A Normal ASTLet’s start with the textbook way to represent an AST. Imagine the world’s simplest language of arithmetic expressions, where all you can do is apply the four basic binary arithmetic operators to literal integers. Some “programs” you can write in this language include 42, 0 + 14 * 3, and (100 - 16) / 2.Maybe the clearest way to write the AST for this language would be as an ML type declaration:But for this post, we’ll use Rust instead. Here are the equivalent types in Rust:If you’re not a committed Rustacean, Box<Expr> may look a little weird, but that’s just Rust for “a plain ol’ pointer to an Expr.” In C, we’d write Expr* to mean morally the same thing; in Java or Python or OCaml, it would just be Expr because everything is a reference by default.1With the AST in hand, we can write all the textbook parts of a language implementation, like a parser, a pretty-printer, and an interpreter.\nAll of them are thoroughly unremarkable.\nThe whole interpreter is just one method on Expr:My language has keep-on-truckin’ semantics; every expression eventually evaluates to an i64, even if it’s not the number you wanted.2For extra credit, I also wrote a little random program generator. It’s also not all that interesting to look at; it just uses a recursively-increasing probability of generating a literal so it eventually terminates. Using fixed PRNG seeds, the random generator enables some easy microbenchmarking. By generating and then immediately evaluating an expression, we can measure the performance of AST manipulation without the I/O costs of parsing and pretty-printing.You can check out the relevant repo and try it out:Flattening the ASTThe flattening idea has two pieces:Let’s look back at the doodle from the top of the post.\nWe want to use a single Expr array to hold all our AST nodes.\nThese nodes still need to point to each other; they’ll now do that by referring to “earlier” slots in that array.\nPlain old integers will take the place of pointers.If that plan sounds simple, it is—it’s probably even simpler than you’re thinking.\nThe main thing we need is an array of Exprs.\nI’ll use Rust’s newtype idiom to declare our arena type, ExprPool, as a shorthand for an Expr vector:To keep things fancy, we’ll also give a name to the plain old integers we’ll use to index into an ExprPool:The idea is that, everywhere we previously used a pointer to an Expr (i.e., Box<Expr> or sometimes &Expr), we’ll use an ExprRef instead.\nExprRefs are just 32-bit unsigned integers, but by giving them this special name, we’ll avoid confusing them with other u32s.\nMost importantly, we need to change the definition of Expr itself:Next, we need to add utilities to ExprPool to create Exprs (allocation) and look them up (dereferencing).\nIn my implementation, these little functions are called add and get, and their implementations are extremely boring.\nTo use them, we need to look over our code and find every place where we create new Exprs or follow a pointer to an Expr.\nFor example, our parse function used to be a method on Expr, but we’ll make it a method on ExprPool instead:And where we used to return a newly allocated Expr directly, we’ll now wrap that in self.add() to return an ExprRef instead.\nHere’s the match case for constructing a literal expression:Our interpreter gets the same treatment.\nIt also becomes an ExprPool method, and we have to add self.get() to go from an ExprRef to an Expr we can pattern-match on:That’s about it.\nI think it’s pretty cool how few changes are required—see for yourself in the complete diff.\nYou replace Box<Expr> with ExprRef, insert add and get calls in the obvious places, and you’ve got a flattened version of your code.\nNeat!But Why?Flattened ASTs come with a bunch of benefits.\nThe classic ones most people cite are all about performance:I think it’s interesting that many introductions to arena allocation tend to focus on cheap deallocation (#4) as the main reason to do it.\nThe Wikipedia page, for example, doesn’t (yet!) mention locality (#1 or #2) at all.\nYou can make an argument that #4 might be the least important for a compiler setting—since ASTs tend to persist all the way to the end of compilation, you might not need to free them at all.Beyond performance, there are also ergonomic advantages:Performance ResultsSince we have two implementations of the same language, let’s measure those performance advantages.\nFor a microbenchmark, I randomly generated a program with about 100 million AST nodes and fed it directly into the interpreter (the parser and pretty printer are not involved).\nThis benchmark is not very realistic: all it does is generate and then immediately run one enormous program.\nSome caveats include:Still, maybe we can learn something.I used Hyperfine to compare the average running time over 10 executions on my laptop.3\nHere’s a graph of the running times (please ignore the “extra-flat” bar; we’ll cover that next).\nThe plot’s error bars show the standard deviation over the 10 runs.\nIn this experiment, the normal version took 3.1 seconds and the flattened version took 1.3 seconds—a 2.4× speedup.\nNot bad for such a straightforward code change!Of that 2.4× performance advantage, I was curious to know how much comes from each of the four potential advantages I mentioned above.\nUnfortunately, I don’t know how to isolate most of these effects—but #4, cheaper deallocation, is especially enticing to isolate.\nSince our interpreter is so simple, it seems silly that we’re spending any time on freeing our Exprs after execution finishes—the program is about to shut down anyway, so leaking that memory is completely harmless.So let’s build versions of both of our interpreters that skip deallocation altogether4 and see how much time they save.\nUnsurprisingly, the “no-free” version of the flattened interpreter takes about the same amount of time as the standard version, suggesting that it doesn’t spend much time on deallocation anyway.\nFor the normal interpreter, however, skipping deallocation takes the running time from 3.1 to 1.9 seconds—it was spending around 38% of its time just on freeing memory!Even comparing the “no-free” versions head-to-head, however, the flattened interpreter is still 1.5× faster than the normal one.\nSo even if you don’t care about deallocation, the other performance ingredients, like locality and cheap allocation, still have measurable effects.Bonus: Exploiting the Flat RepresentationSo far, flattening has happened entirely “under the hood”:\narenas and integer offsets serve as drop-in replacements for normal allocation and pointers.\nWhat could we do if we broke this abstraction layer—if we exploited stuff about the flattened representation that isn’t true about normal AST style?The idea is to build a third kind of interpreter that exploits an extra fact about ExprPools that arises from the way we built it up.\nBecause Exprs are immutable, we have to construct trees of them “bottom-up”:\nwe have to create all child Exprs before we can construct their parent.\nIf we build the expression a * b, a and b must appear earlier in their ExprPool than the * that refers to them.\nLet’s bring that doodle back again: visually, you can imagine that reference arrows always go backward in the array, and data always flows forward.Let’s write a new interpreter that exploits this invariant.\nInstead of starting at the root of the tree and recursively evaluating each child, we can start at the beginning of the ExprPool and scan from left to right.\nThis iteration is guaranteed to visit parents after children, so we can be sure that the results for subexpressions will be ready when we need them.\nHere’s the whole thing:We use a dense state table to hold one result value per Expr.\nThe state[i] = res line fills this vector up whenever we finish an expression.\nCritically, there’s no recursion—binary expressions can get the value of their subexpressions by looking them up directly in state.\nAt the end, when state is completely full of results, all we need to do is return the one corresponding to the requested expression, root.This “extra-flat” interpreter has two potential performance advantages over the recursive interpreter:\nthere’s no stack bookkeeping for the recursive calls,\nand the linear traversal of the ExprPool could be good for locality.\nOn the other hand, it has to randomly access a really big state vector, which could be bad for locality.To see if it wins overall, let’s return to our bar chart from earlier.\nThe extra-flat interpreter takes 1.2 seconds, compared to 1.3 seconds for the recursive interpreter for the flat AST.\nThat’s marginal compared to how much better flattening does on its own than the pointer-based version,\nbut an 8.2% performance improvement ain’t nothing.My favorite observation about this technique, due to a Reddit comment by Bob Nystrom, is that it essentially reinvents the idea of a bytecode interpreter.\nThe Expr structs are bytecode instructions, and they contain variable references encoded as u32s.\nYou could make this interpreter even better by swapping out our simple state table for some kind of stack, and then it would really be no different from a bytecode interpreter you might design from first principles.\nI just think it’s pretty nifty that “merely” changing our AST data structure led us directly from the land of tree walking to the land of bytecode.Further ReadingI asked on Mastodon a while back for pointers to other writing about data structure flattening,\nand folks really came through (thanks, everybody!).\nHere are some other places it came up in a compilers context:Beyond just language implementation, similar concepts show up in other performance-oriented domains.\nI admit that I understand this stuff less, especially the things from the world of video games:After I published this post, many people pointed me toward a post from last year by Inanna Malick that shows the same technique applied to same kind of toy “calculator” language implemented in Rust.\nThat post also uses recursion schemes, an elegant idea from the Haskell world that helps abstract over different concrete representations.\nI highly recommend checking that post out.In Rust, using Expr there would mean that we want to include other Exprs inline inside the Expr struct, without any pointers, which isn’t what we want. The Rust compiler doesn’t even let us do that—it would make Exprs infinitely large! ↩The totality-at-all-costs approach uses Rust’s wrapping integer arithmetic functions and abuses checked division to boldly assert that dividing by zero yields zero. ↩A MacBook Pro with an M1 Max (10 cores, 3.2 GHz) and 32 GB of main memory running macOS 13.3.1 and Rust 1.69.0. ↩I added a feature flag that enables calls to Rust’s std::mem::forget. ↩	2023-06-08	{"title":"Flattening ASTs: A Simple and Effective Technique for Compilers","article":"\\nModern language implementations heavily rely on arenas or regions, which are data structures that manage memory allocation.

In this section, we will explore the assembly code generated for match on an enum and how it relates to the memory organization of enums.\\n\\nAssembly Code Generated for Self Passed by Value, Reference, or as a Smart Pointer\\n\\nIn Rust, self is a keyword that refers to the current instance of a struct or enum. When passing self as an argument, developers have several options, including passing by value, reference, or as a smart pointer. Each of these options has its own assembly code generated by the Rust compiler.\\n\\nUnderstanding how the memory is organized in these cases can help developers write more efficient code and avoid unnecessary memory allocations.\\n\\nMapping Rust Data Types to Assembly\\n\\nRust has several data types, including arrays, tuples, Box, and Option. Each of these data types has its own memory organization and assembly code generated by the Rust compiler.\\n\\nIn this section, we will explore how these data types are represented in memory and the assembly code generated for each type. We will also cover how to map Rust vector iteration to assembly and how the compiler optimizes the loop with vector instructions.\\n\\nMapping a Bool Vector to String Slice Vector and Owned String Vector\\n\\nMapping a Vec<bool> to a Vec<& 'static str> (static string slice vector) or a Vec<String> (owned string) can be a challenging task for Rust developers. In this section, we will explore the assembly code generated when mapping a bool vector to a string slice vector or owned string vector.\\n\\nWe will cover the allocations and de-allocations operations involved in this process and how developers can optimize their code to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.\\n\\nComparing Static vs Dynamic Dispatch in Rust\\n\\nRust's trait system allows developers to define a set of methods that can be implemented by multiple types. When calling a method on a trait object, Rust uses either static or dynamic dispatch to determine which implementation to use.\\n\\nIn this section, we will compare the assembly code generated for static vs dynamic dispatch for traits. We will also explore the performance implications of each approach and how developers can optimize their code for performance.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nUnderstanding Rust's assembly code can be a challenging task for developers. However, by gaining a deeper understanding of how Rust works under the hood, developers can write more efficient and performant code.\\n\\nIn this article, we explored Rust's assembly code for enums, self passed by value, reference, or as a smart pointer, mapping Rust data types to assembly, Rust vector iteration to assembly, mapping a bool vector to a string slice vector or owned string vector, and comparing static vs dynamic dispatch in Rust.\\n\\nBy applying this knowledge to their Rust code, developers can take full advantage of Rust's performance, safety, and memory management features."}

That's where cs comes in. cs is a command line tool written in Go that makes it easy to search through code quickly and efficiently. In this article, we'll take a closer look at cs and how it can help you be more productive.\\n\\nOne of the key features of cs is its simplicity. It's a lightweight tool that doesn't require a lot of setup or configuration. Once you've installed it, you can start using it right away. To search for a string in a codebase, all you need to do is run the following command:\\n\\n```\\ncs <search term>\\n```\\n\\nThis will search through all files in the current directory and its subdirectories for the specified search term. You can also specify a file extension to limit the search to specific file types. For example, to search only for Python files, you can run:\\n\\n```\\ncs <search term> --ext py\\n```\\n\\ncs also supports regular expressions, which can be useful for more complex searches. To use regular expressions, simply add the `-r` flag to your search command. For example:\\n\\n```\\ncs 'foo.*bar' -r\\n```\\n\\nAnother useful feature of cs is its ability to search through Git repositories. If you're working on a project that uses Git, you can use cs to search through the code history. To search through the Git history, simply add the `--git` flag to your search command. For example:\\n\\n```\\ncs <search term> --git\\n```\\n\\nThis will search through all commits in the Git history for the specified search term.\\n\\nOne thing to keep in mind when using cs is that it's designed to be a fast, lightweight tool. It's not meant to replace more advanced code search tools like grep or ack. However, for simple searches or quick lookups, cs can be a great tool to have in your toolbox.\\n\\nIn terms of performance, cs is quite fast. It's written in Go, which is known for its speed and efficiency. This means that even for large codebases, cs can search through files quickly and without using too many system resources.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cs is a simple and efficient command line code search tool that can help you be more productive as a developer. Whether you're searching through a small codebase or a large Git repository, cs can help you find what you're looking for quickly and easily. So why not give it a try and see how it can improve your workflow?"}

KEDA is an open-source project that provides event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads.\nPrerequisites\nGo (version 1.16 or later): We’ll use Go to write our publisher and subscriber applications.\nDocker: We’ll use Docker to build and package our Go application.\nKubernetes CLI (kubectl): We’ll use kubectl to interact with our Kubernetes cluster.\nHelm: We’ll use Helm to deploy KEDA on our Kubernetes cluster.\nAdditionally, you’ll need an AKS cluster for deploying our application and KEDA. If you don’t have an AKS cluster ready to use, you can create an AKS cluster by following this Azure documentation.\nTable of Contents:\nDeploying KEDA on AKS\nBuilding a Golang Application for Event-Driven Scaling\nPackaging and Deploying Golang Application in AKS\nTesting Event-Driven Scaling\nConclusion\nDeploying KEDA on AKS\nWe’ll use Helm, a Kubernetes package manager, to deploy KEDA on AKS. Run the following commands to add the KEDA Helm chart repository and install KEDA:\nhelm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts\nhelm repo update\nkubectl create namespace keda\nhelm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda\nBuilding a Golang Application for Event-Driven Scaling\nLet’s build a simple Golang application that reads messages from an Azure Storage Queue. The number of pods in the deployment will automatically scale up or go scale down based on the number of messages in the Azure Storage Queue. Here’s a simple Go script that reads messages from Azure Storage Queue:\npackage main\nimport ( "context" "fmt" "github.com/Azure/azure-storage-queue-go/azqueue" "os"\n)\nfunc main() { connectionString := os.Getenv("AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING") queueName := os.Getenv("QUEUE_NAME") queueURL := azqueue.NewServiceURLFromConnectionString(connectionString).NewQueueURL(queueName) for { messagesURL := queueURL.NewMessagesURL() messages, _ := messagesURL.Dequeue(context.Background(), 32, 30) for _, message := range messages.QueueMessages { fmt.Printf("Processing message: %s\\n", *message.MessageText) messageURL := messagesURL.NewMessageIDURL(*message.MessageID) messageURL.Delete(context.Background(), message.PopReceipt) } }\n}\nPackaging and Deploying Golang Application in AKS\nWe need to package our Go application using Docker. Create a Dockerfile for the same:\nFROM golang:1.16\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY go.mod ./\nCOPY go.sum ./\nRUN go mod download\nCOPY . .\nRUN go build -o main .\nCMD [ "./main" ]\nAfter building the Docker image and pushing it to a Docker registry, we create a Kubernetes deployment for our application. However, to enable KEDA, we need to create a ScaledObject which defines the scaling parameters:\napiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1\nkind: ScaledObject\nmetadata: name: golang-scaledobject\nspec: scaleTargetRef: name: golang-deployment triggers: - type: azure-queue metadata: connectionFromEnv: AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING queueName: myqueue queueLength: '5'\nTesting Event-Driven Scaling\nTo test the event-driven scaling, add messages to the Azure Storage Queue and observe the number of pods of your Golang application. You should see more pods when there are more messages in the queue and fewer pods when there are fewer messages in the queue.\nConclusion\nThis article walked you through setting up event-driven scaling of a Golang application in Azure Kubernetes Service using Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA). This capability is crucial in building highly scalable and responsive applications that automatically adjust their resources based on demand.\nSubscribe to Faizan Bashir\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\nSubscribe\nFaizan Bashir\nPrincipal Engineer | Architecting and building distributed applications in the Cloud | Adventurer\nRead More\nEvent-Driven Scaling of Golang Applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using KEDAEvent-Driven Scaling of Golang Applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using KEDAThis article will guide you through setting up event-driven scaling of a Golang application deployed in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA).

This capability is crucial in building highly scalable and responsive applications that automatically adjust their resources based on demand.Subscribe to Faizan BashirGet the latest posts delivered right to your inboxFaizan BashirPrincipal Engineer | Architecting and building distributed applications in the Cloud | AdventurerGolangMigrating Legacy Python Applications to Azure Kubernetes Service AKSBuilding a Messaging System with NATS, Golang, and Azure Kubernetes ServiceSubscribe to Faizan BashirStay up to date!

KEDA is an open-source project that provides event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads, allowing developers to automatically scale their applications based on events.\\n\\nBefore diving into the setup process, there are a few prerequisites that need to be in place. Firstly, Go (version 1.16 or later) will be used to write the publisher and subscriber applications. Secondly, Docker will be used to build and package the Go application. Thirdly, kubectl will be used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. Finally, Helm will be used to deploy KEDA on the Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, an AKS cluster will be required for deploying the application and KEDA.\\n\\nTo deploy KEDA on AKS, Helm, a Kubernetes package manager, will be used. The following commands can be run to add the KEDA Helm chart repository and install KEDA:\\n\\n```\\nhelm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts\\nhelm repo update\\nkubectl create namespace keda\\nhelm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda\\n```\\n\\nOnce KEDA is installed, the next step is to build the Golang application for event-driven scaling. This can be achieved by writing the publisher and subscriber applications in Go, which will communicate with each other using Azure Service Bus. The publisher application will send messages to the Service Bus, which will trigger the subscriber application to process the messages.\\n\\nAfter building the application, it needs to be packaged and deployed in AKS. This can be done by creating a Docker image of the application and pushing it to a container registry. The image can then be deployed to AKS using kubectl.\\n\\nFinally, testing event-driven scaling can be done by sending messages to the Service Bus and monitoring the scaling behavior of the application. As more messages are sent, KEDA will automatically scale the application based on the defined scaling rules.\\n\\nIn conclusion, event-driven scaling using KEDA is a powerful tool for automatically scaling Golang applications in AKS. By following the steps outlined in this article, developers can easily set up event-driven scaling for their applications and ensure that they are always running at optimal capacity."}

However, it's easy to accidentally create \\"keyboard traps\\" where a user cannot move focus away from an interactive element or control using the keyboard alone. That's where the \\"a11y-onkeydown\\" package comes in.\\n\\nThis package provides a simple, reusable hook that allows you to trigger onKeyDown events only when certain keys are pressed, avoiding the need to check the key every time. This is especially useful when working with interactive elements that require keyboard event handlers.\\n\\nTo use the hook, simply import it from the package and pass it as the value for the onKeyDown attribute of your element. By default, the hook will trigger onKeyDown for any key except for \\"Shift\\" and \\"Tab\\", allowing keyboard users to tab up and down the tab stack. Here's an example:\\n\\n```\\nimport { useKeyDown } from 'a11y-onkeydown';\\n\\nfunction MyButton({ text, handleSelect }) {\\n  return (\\n    <div\\n      role=\\"button\\"\\n      tabIndex={0}\\n      onClick={handleSelect}\\n      onKeyDown={useKeyDown(handleSelect)}\\n    >\\n      {text}\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the \\"handleSelect\\" function will be called when the user presses any key except for \\"Shift\\" and \\"Tab\\". However, you may want to only call onKeyDown if certain keys are pressed. In that case, you can pass an array of strings as the second argument to useKeyDown. For example, if you only want to trigger onKeyDown when the user presses \\"Enter\\", \\"ArrowUp\\", or \\"ArrowDown\\", you can do this:\\n\\n```\\nimport { useKeyDown } from 'a11y-onkeydown';\\n\\nfunction MyButton({ text, handleSelect }) {\\n  return (\\n    <div\\n      role=\\"button\\"\\n      tabIndex={0}\\n      onClick={handleSelect}\\n      onKeyDown={useKeyDown(handleSelect, ['Enter', 'ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown'])}\\n    >\\n      {text}\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWith this configuration, the \\"handleSelect\\" function will only be called when the user presses one of the specified keys.\\n\\nIn summary, \\"a11y-onkeydown\\" is a simple and useful package for making your React applications more accessible to keyboard users. By using this hook, you can avoid creating keyboard traps and provide a better user experience for all."}

One example is Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and it's relationship with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). When you visit a site, the server should send back a full page of HTML for your browser to start rendering.But there's a catch: If that HTML contains references to CSS files, the browser can't start rendering the page until that CSS is fully downloaded and parsed!Global CSSBy default Nuxt 3 will inject your global CSS into a file called entry.css (with a hash), and link to it from the server response.Nuxt tries to speed up this download by adding a preload tag early on, but honestly this doesn't do much since the CSS file is discovered very early by the preload scanner. Even without this preload, the scanner finds the CSS reference before the page is even done downloading!The ProblemSince the browser has to download entry.css before it can render the page, any little hickup in your internet connection could directly affect your site experience and core web vitals! If you use UI frameworks (cough Tailwind) this file could also become pretty large.Keep in mind, when it comes to web performance the problem often isn't only network speed, it's the delay! If your website is in the United States and someone is hitting it from Asia, it will take a while to even start downloading your file because the packets have to physically travel across the planet!Option 1: Inline Your Global CSSOne solution is to avoid forcing the browser to download this file at all. Inject it into the initial server response instead!This technique may not work if other Nuxt Modules inject their own CSS into the build process.Move Nuxt Config CSS Files Into App.vueTo get your global CSS into the initial server response you have to move any css files from your nuxt.config.ts into App.vue.If you use a custom error.vue file, be sure to add the imports there too.Nuke The Entry.css FileSince we are injecting our global CSS into the App, we no longer this global file.Success!After you've made these two tweaks you should no longer see your entry.css file and instead see your CSS within your page.What About [Page].css files?When you first hit a page or navigate to a new page you may see more CSS files being downloaded. What's up with those? Are they a problem?The short answer is no.When Nuxt 3 is hydrating the page on initial load, it runs the Javascript for the page. Most likely the same code that would be ran if you had hit the page client-side which would include all of the CSS needed to render the new virtual page.Technically on first page hits those styles are duplicated but at least they aren't render blocking since they are added via Javascript.Nuxt 2 did the same thing, you just didn't notice because the styles weren't extracted into their own CSS files. They were embeded right into the Javascript files.Option 2: Keep The CSS FileIf you insist on keeping your global CSS in a seperate file, at least do these basic steps to cut down on the performance hit.Using all of these techniques, you could easily speed up the download of your global CSS by as much as 300ms on slower mobile connections!More Performance Articles	2023-06-08	{"title":"Improving Page Performance with Nuxt 3's Render-Blocking CSS Solution","article":"\\nWhen it comes to page performance and web vitals, small tweaks can make a big difference.

However, if that HTML contains references to CSS files, the browser can't start rendering the page until that CSS is fully downloaded and parsed. This can cause delays in page load times and affect the user experience.\\n\\nNuxt 3, the latest version of the popular Vue.js framework, offers a solution to this problem with its Render-Blocking CSS feature. By default, Nuxt 3 injects global CSS into a file called entry.css (with a hash), and links to it from the server response. However, this can cause delays in page rendering as the browser must download the CSS file before it can start rendering the page.\\n\\nTo address this issue, Nuxt 3's Render-Blocking CSS solution allows developers to split their CSS into critical and non-critical parts. Critical CSS is inlined into the HTML, while non-critical CSS is loaded asynchronously. This allows the browser to start rendering the page with the critical CSS, while the non-critical CSS is downloaded and parsed in the background.\\n\\nTo use Render-Blocking CSS in Nuxt 3, developers can use the <client-only> component to load non-critical CSS asynchronously. Here's an example:\\n\\n<template>\\n  <div>\\n    <h1>Hello World!</h1>\\n    <client-only>\\n      <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"/non-critical.css\\">\\n    </client-only>\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n\\nIn this example, the non-critical CSS is loaded asynchronously using the <client-only> component.

This is especially important for websites with large CSS files, such as those that use UI frameworks like Tailwind.\\n\\nIn addition to Render-Blocking CSS, Nuxt 3 offers a range of other performance optimizations, including automatic image optimization, code splitting, and lazy loading. These features make it easier for developers to create fast and responsive websites that meet the latest web performance standards.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Nuxt 3's Render-Blocking CSS solution is a powerful tool for improving page performance and user experience. By splitting CSS into critical and non-critical parts, developers can reduce page load times and ensure that their websites meet the latest web performance standards."}

In this article, I’ll guide you through TypeScript’s configuration capabilities using the tsconfig.json file. We’ll explore some commonly used compiler options that allow you to customize and optimize your projects.tsconfig and Compiler OptionsIn TypeScript, the tsconfig.json file is used to configure the compiler options for a TypeScript project. It provides a way to specify how the TypeScript compiler should behave and what rules should be enforced during the compilation process.With these configurations, you can ensure proper type checking, compatibility, and output configuration. If you don’t already have a tsconfig.json file in your project, create manually of run the following command:tsc --initMake sure to check out the comprehensive list of all available compiler options in the TypeScript documentation. In the meantime, let’s explore some of the file’s most useful properties.Include, Exclude and Files propertiesThese properties provide flexibility in determining which files should be included or excluded from the TypeScript compilation process, by specifying file patterns or individual files.Configuration Inheritance with ExtendsYou can use the ‘extends’ property to inherit configuration settings from another tsconfig.json file. It references another configuration file, and the compiler options from that file are merged with the current tsconfig.json file. Let’s see some examples:The resulting configuration combines all the compiler options from different sources to create a complete set of options for your project. When merging configurations, the properties in your current tsconfig.json file take precedence over the inherited properties.Output Locations, Tweaks and Emitting On ErrorIn TypeScript’s tsconfig.json file, you can configure the output locations of compiled JavaScript files, make adjustments to the emitted code, and specify whether or not files should be emitted in case of errors.1. The ‘outDir’ property specifies the output directory for compiled JS files. It determines where the emitted JS files will be placed. In the example below, the JS files will be emitted to the dist directory:2. The ‘outFile’ property specifies a single bundled JS file that combines all the emitted JS files. It is useful when you want to concatenate and bundle multiple files into a single output file. In the example below, all the emitted JS files will be bundled into a single file named bundle.js:1. The ‘removeComments’ property which controls whether comments should be preserved or removed from the emitted JS code. By default, it is set to false, preserving comments.2. The ‘sourceMap’ property which determines whether source map* files should be generated along with the emitted JS code. By default, it is set to false.When ‘sourceMap’ option is enabled, the TS compiler will generate source map files (with a .map extension) alongside the emitted JS files.By default:- TypeScript emits external source map files that are referenced by a://# sourceMappingURL comment at the end of the compiled JS file. However, you can also choose to emit inline source maps within the JS files themselves, by setting ‘inlineSourceMap’ compiler option to true.- TypeScript emits the source map files in the same directory as the corresponding JS files. However, you can customize the output location of the source map files using the ‘sourceRoot’ and ‘mapRoot’ compiler options.The ‘sourceRoot’ option specifies the root directory for the TS source files to “./src”. It is the base path or reference point for resolving the relative paths of the source files.The ‘mapRoot’ option indicates the directory where the source map files will be emitted — “./maps”. This path is relative to the root directory specified by ‘sourceRoot’. In this case, the source maps will be emitted in the “./maps” directory inside the “./src” directory.These options help maintain proper paths and organization for the TS source files and their corresponding source map files during the compilation process.Use the ‘noEmitOnError’ property, which controls whether TS should emit JS files when there are compilation errors. By default, it is set to false, which means TS will still emit JS files even if there are errors.If you don’t want to emit any JS files, regardless of compilation errors, use:Understanding “lib” and ES librariesWhile it is common to configure both “target” and “lib” together to ensure compatibility, it is not mandatory. You can configure each option independently based on your project’s needs.In the given configuration, the TS compiler will include specific libraries:By specifying these, you ensure that TS incorporates their type definitions, allowing for proper type checking.Strict Flags for Enhanced SafetyRefer to a set of compiler flags that enable strict type-checking and enforce stricter rules to enhance the safety and reliability of your codebase. These flags help catch potential errors, enforce better coding practices, and improve the overall quality of your TypeScript projects.Here are a few examples:You can enable these flags in your tsconfig.json file (by setting the respective flag values to true if needed) or through command-line options.Transpiling and Experimental FeaturesBy transpiling TypeScript code into JavaScript, you can leverage modern JS features while ensuring compatibility with various environments. Additionally, TS provides support for experimental ECMAScript proposals, allowing you to use features that are not yet standardized or fully supported across all JS environments.These experimental features are enabled through the “experimentalDecorators” and “emitDecoratorMetadata” compiler options. For further details and examples, you can refer to TypeScript’s documentation by clicking on each option.ConclusionIn this article, we have provided an overview of the tsconfig.json file and explored essential properties that you must be familiar with. By understanding these properties, you can confidently begin configuring TypeScript to enhance your development workflow and ensure code quality!I hope you found this post useful. ✨Stay tuned for future content!

One of the key features of TypeScript is its ability to be configured to suit specific project needs. In this article, we’ll dive into TypeScript’s configuration capabilities using the tsconfig.json file and explore some commonly used compiler options that allow you to customize and optimize your projects.\\n\\ntsconfig and Compiler Options\\nThe tsconfig.json file is used to configure the compiler options for a TypeScript project. It provides a way to specify how the TypeScript compiler should behave and what rules should be enforced during the compilation process. With these configurations, you can ensure proper type checking, compatibility, and output configuration.\\n\\nIf you don’t already have a tsconfig.json file in your project, you can create one manually or run the following command:\\n```\\ntsc --init\\n```\\n\\nThe tsconfig.json file contains a variety of options that can be used to configure your TypeScript project. Some of the most commonly used options are:\\n\\nInclude, Exclude and Files Properties\\nThese properties provide flexibility in determining which files should be included or excluded from the TypeScript compilation process, by specifying file patterns or individual files. For example, you can use the Include property to specify a list of files to be included in the compilation process, while the Exclude property can be used to exclude specific files or directories from the compilation process.\\n\\nCompiler Options\\nThe Compiler Options section of the tsconfig.json file contains a variety of options that can be used to customize the TypeScript compiler behavior. Some of the most commonly used options are:\\n\\n- Target: Specifies the ECMAScript target version that the TypeScript code should be compiled to.\\n- Module: Specifies the module system that the TypeScript code should be compiled to.\\n- SourceMap: Generates a source map file that can be used to debug the TypeScript code in the browser.\\n- Strict: Enforces strict type checking rules.\\n- NoImplicitAny: Raises an error if a variable has an implicit any type.\\n- OutDir: Specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files.\\n\\nUsing these options, you can customize the TypeScript compiler behavior to suit your project needs.\\n\\nTypeScript Plugins\\nIn addition to the compiler options, TypeScript also supports plugins that can be used to extend the functionality of the compiler. Some of the most popular TypeScript plugins are:\\n\\n- ts-loader: A webpack plugin that allows you to use TypeScript with webpack.\\n- tslint: A linter for TypeScript that checks for coding errors and style issues.\\n- @types: A collection of type definitions for popular JavaScript libraries.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn this article, we’ve explored TypeScript’s configuration capabilities using the tsconfig.json file and some commonly used compiler options. By configuring your TypeScript project, you can ensure proper type checking, compatibility, and output configuration. Additionally, TypeScript plugins can be used to extend the functionality of the compiler and provide additional features. As a developer, it’s important to keep up with the latest news and trends in the industry, and TypeScript’s configuration capabilities are a valuable tool in your arsenal."}

969	Getting Started with a New Vue.js Project in 2023	https://medium.com/bitsrc/getting-started-with-a-new-vue-js-project-in-2023-7ea97498ab6a	published	reddit	Sign upSign InSign upSign InGetting Started with a New Vue.js Project in 2023Building Better Vue.js Applications in 2023Lakindu HewawasamFollowBits and Pieces--ListenShareA short backstory — Vue.jsVue.js is a framework built on top of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that seamlessly offers a component-driven architecture to build mission-critical production apps. When it was first announced in 2014, it took the software industry by storm, offering a better (and more progressive) approach to building frontend applications.Unlike its competitors (React and Angular), Vue.js was specifically designed to bridge the gaps between React and Angular. It aimed to improve frontend components’ maintainability and testability by offering a more progressive approach to developing frontend apps.It let users maintain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code, all in a single file, which significantly helped improve component maintainability and testability.Yet, it still wasn’t enough.One crucial piece remained the same. Vue.js developers still had to develop and maintain their production apps as a single giant monolith. Though this works for small projects, it does not scale well for large apps.Customers in 2023 want you to build complex apps faster.However, developing giant Vue.js monolithic apps will not help you make such complex apps quickly. Therefore, you need to look at a better approach if you build production apps with Vue.js in 2023.Well, how can we do better?Recently, I came across a modernized approach towards frontend development through distributed component-driven architectures. It focuses on building frontend apps in a distributed manner, where each component could be independently designed, developed, tested, and versioned. We can significantly improve how we develop production-ready Vue.js applications by adopting this new approach.So, what exactly is a distributed component-driven architecture?A component-driven architecture aims to increase component reusability by decomposing large complex applications into simpler components. However, you might find this confusing as you’ve likely built many Vue.js apps through components.However, in 2023, building components don’t cut it. You’re still trapped inside a giant monolith application, and you lose the ability to scale the app as you grow.This is where tools like Bit come into play. Bit is a tool that helps developers build distributed component-driven applications and collaborate on components independent of a Git repo or any other development setup. It allows you to freely adopt architectural patterns such as the Micro Frontends pattern to improve your development productivity, reduce costs, and align it with your backend microservice.As shown above, each component is located in a separate space (isolated from the rest). Adopting such an approach allows you to design, develop, test, and version a single component in total isolation.You no longer need access to your entire production application to change a single component! All you will need is access to your single component, which, once changed and versioned, will cycle back through its dependency tree and update all its dependents.And, just like that, this helps save a massive amount of time as you no longer need to wait for an app to compile after making a mere change to a component’s background colour!Unlock the Power of Vue.js with BitToday, we are super excited to introduce the Vue development environment (Vue env) on Bit and the official docs for…bit.devLet’s build a distributed component-driven app with Vue.jsStep 01 — Pre-requisitesFirst, you must set up Bit in your local development environment before developing a modular Vue.js app.If you’ve configured Bit, ensure you are on the latest version.You can install Bit by executing the command shown below:To confirm the installation, run the command bit --version. You should see the output I've illustrated below.Next, create an account on Bit and create a scope to export the components you will build along with me in this article!Step 02 — Initializing the development environmentNext, you will need some development space to compose your components. In Bit, this is known as a “Workspace”. Therefore, you must create a workspace that can be used to develop your Vue.js components. This can be done with the command shown below.When you run this command, ensure that you provide your organization and scope name and replace the default “my-org.my-scope”. For my case, I provided my Bit username and the scope I created in step 01 — “lakindu2002.demo-vue-js".The command above creates a new Bit workspace that will be configured to design and develop Vue.js components. It uses the teambut.vue/vue environment to provide a runtime for the Vue.js components to run.Next, run bit start and visit http://localhost:3000 to launch your local development environment to start building your Vue.js components. You will see the snippet below.Step 03 — Creating a Vue.js componentNow that your development server is running, you can start building your Vue.js components! With Bit, creating a Vue.js component can be done in one simple command:If you’re not familiar with a namespace is — think of it as a subdirectory to store your components inSo, if you were creating a design component such as a button, you’d write the command — bit create vue design/button. This lets you organize your components neatly within a scope. After you run the command, you'll see the directory shown below.The biggest difference is that the Bit component is not tied to any Vue.js application. Instead, its Vue.js environment can be used to independently develop, test, and version the component.At a single glance, it’s evident that this brings about several advantages for a developer:Step 04 — Developing a Vue.js componentNow that we’ve created a simple component (Button), let’s start building the component. Let’s start by defining the test cases for the component! Open up your button.spec.ts file and include the code below.We’ve included three test cases for your application.These test cases mean that the Button component must have a default label — Hello World, and we must allow users to change this label while providing support to change the background color.Well, let’s start designing the Button component now.Open up the button.vue file and include the code shown below:The code shown above defined a simple Button Vue.js component. It accepts two props - label and style to help customize the Button to help support the requirements of changing the label and color.Next, save your code and observe the development server to see your component being rendered in real time!Hereafter, you can define your compositions to provide the support for your test cases to function and showcase your component’s capability! Therefore, create two new files inside the button directory:Hereafter, include the snippets shown below to define the composition.The two snippets defined above showcases the two compositions. Hereafter, open the button.composition.ts file and include the code shown below.The snippet shown above lets the spec.ts file import the components defined to help run the test cases.Step 05 — Building a Vue.js applicationNow you may wonder — “I’ve built the component, but how do I consume it?” Well, this is where the App component comes into play. Bit lets you create an App component that provides a deployable runtime for your components and enables you to build fully functional production apps using Vue.js!To create your application, execute the command shown below.The command above creates a Vue.js application titled hello-app . This will create the folder structure shown below.Open up the hello-app.vue and include the code below to help you use your custom Button component.As shown above, this is the Button component that we created earlier! Next, you will need to let the workspace load the App as a separate instance. To do so, run the command shown below.Finally, run the following command to launch your new Vue.js app!Yes, you will need to use “app-app” if you created the app by appending “app” to the name. If you only provided “bit create app hello”, use “bit run “hello-app”.Once doing so, you can browse the application locally.Step 06 — Versioning and sharing the codeAfter you’ve built your app, you can now ship it to remote storage — scope for future maintenance.To do so, you must “tag” your components to version them and export them to the Bit Cloud.You can version your component by running bit tag followed by a message. For example, your command could be bit tag -m "adding a property for the button name". What's unique about this command is that it builds the component and executes its test cases to ensure you release only fully functional code.Finally, after you’ve tagged a new version of your component, you can ship it off to the component repository — Bit Cloud using the command bit export.Well, wasn’t this a promising approach for developing Vue.js apps?Building frontends have come a long way since Vue.js was first launched. Gone are the times when developers tried to manage single giant monolith frontend apps. Out came the dawn of micro frontends and Bit — A modernized approach to building modular and distributed components that can be developed, tested, and versioned in isolation!To explore what we built in this blog post, visit my GitHub Repository on Bit Cloud and have a peek!I hope that this article helps you build amazing Vue.js apps in 2023!Thank you for reading.Versioning independent components the easy way using BitBit’s open-source tool help 250,000+ devs to build apps with components.Turn any UI, feature, or page into a reusable component — and share it across your applications.

Since its release in 2014, Vue.js has gained a significant following among developers due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.\\n\\nHowever, as the demand for complex and scalable applications continues to grow, developers need to adopt new approaches to building Vue.js applications. In this article, we will explore some of the best practices for building scalable and maintainable Vue.js applications in 2023.\\n\\nBreaking Down the Monolith\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges in building large Vue.js applications is maintaining a monolithic codebase. A monolithic codebase is a single codebase that contains all the application's features, making it difficult to maintain and scale.\\n\\nTo overcome this challenge, developers need to break down the monolith into smaller, manageable components. This approach, known as micro-frontends, allows developers to build and maintain individual components independently, making it easier to scale and maintain the application.\\n\\nUsing State Management Libraries\\n\\nAnother challenge in building Vue.js applications is managing the application's state. State management refers to how an application manages and updates its data over time.\\n\\nVue.js offers a built-in state management library called Vuex, which provides a centralized store for managing the application's state. However, as applications grow in complexity, developers may need to use other state management libraries such as Redux or MobX.\\n\\nThese libraries provide more advanced features such as time-travel debugging, middleware, and observables, making it easier to manage complex application states.\\n\\nAdopting Server-Side Rendering\\n\\nServer-side rendering (SSR) is a technique that allows developers to render Vue.js applications on the server before sending them to the client. SSR provides several benefits, such as improved performance, search engine optimization, and better user experience.\\n\\nVue.js offers built-in support for SSR, making it easier for developers to adopt this technique. By rendering the application on the server, developers can reduce the time it takes to load the application, resulting in a faster and more responsive user experience.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nVue.js is an excellent framework for building frontend applications, but as the demand for complex and scalable applications grows, developers need to adopt new approaches to building Vue.js applications.\\n\\nBy breaking down the monolith, using state management libraries, and adopting server-side rendering, developers can build more scalable and maintainable Vue.js applications in 2023 and beyond. As always, keeping up with the latest trends and best practices is essential for staying ahead in the ever-evolving world of web development."}

46	AlphaDev discovers faster sorting algorithms	https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms	published	reddit	AlphaDev discovers faster sorting algorithmsAlphaDev discovers faster sorting algorithmsNew algorithms will transform the foundations of computingDigital society is driving increasing demand for computation, and energy use. For the last five decades, we relied on improvements in hardware to keep pace. But as microchips approach their physical limits, it’s critical to improve the code that runs on them to make computing more powerful and sustainable. This is especially important for the algorithms that make up the code running trillions of times a day. In our paper published today in Nature, we introduce AlphaDev, an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses reinforcement learning to discover enhanced computer science algorithms – surpassing those honed by scientists and engineers over decades. AlphaDev uncovered a faster algorithm for sorting, a method for ordering data. Billions of people use these algorithms everyday without realising it. They underpin everything from ranking online search results and social posts to how data is processed on computers and phones. Generating better algorithms using AI will transform how we program computers and impact all aspects of our increasingly digital society. By open sourcing our new sorting algorithms in the main C++ library, millions of developers and companies around the world now use it on AI applications across industries from cloud computing and online shopping to supply chain management. This is the first change to this part of the sorting library in over a decade and the first time an algorithm designed through reinforcement learning has been added to this library. We see this as an important stepping stone for using AI to optimise the world’s code, one algorithm at a time. What is sorting?Sorting is a method of organising a number of items in a particular order. Examples include alphabetising three letters, arranging five numbers from biggest to smallest, or ordering a database of millions of records. This method has evolved throughout history. One of the earliest examples dates back to the second and third century when scholars alphabetised thousands of books by hand on the shelves of the Great Library of Alexandria. Following the industrial revolution, came the invention of machines that could help with sorting – tabulation machines stored information on punch cards which were used to collect the 1890 census results in the United States. And with the rise of commercial computers in the 1950s, we saw the development of the earliest computer science algorithms for sorting. Today, there are many different sorting techniques and algorithms which are used in codebases around the world to organise massive amounts of data online. Contemporary algorithms took computer scientists and programmers decades of research to develop. They’re so efficient that making further improvements is a major challenge, akin to trying to find a new way to save electricity or a more efficient mathematical approach. These algorithms are also a cornerstone of computer science, taught in introductory computer science classes at universities. Searching for new algorithmsAlphaDev uncovered faster algorithms by starting from scratch rather than refining existing algorithms, and began looking where most humans don’t: the computer’s assembly instructions. Assembly instructions are used to create binary code for computers to put into action. While developers write in coding languages like C++, known as high-level languages, this must be translated into ‘low-level’ assembly instructions for computers to understand. We believe many improvements exist at this lower level that may be difficult to discover in a higher-level coding language. Computer storage and operations are more flexible at this level, which means there are significantly more potential improvements that could have a larger impact on speed and energy usage. Finding the best algorithms with a gameAlphaDev is based on AlphaZero, our reinforcement learning model that defeated world champions in games like Go, chess and shogi. With AlphaDev, we show how this model can transfer from games to scientific challenges, and from simulations to real-world applications.To train AlphaDev to uncover new algorithms, we transformed sorting into a single player ‘assembly game’. At each turn, AlphaDev observes the algorithm it has generated and the information contained in the central processing unit (CPU). Then it plays a move by choosing an instruction to add to the algorithm.. The assembly game is incredibly hard because AlphaDev has to efficiently search through an enormous number of possible combinations of instructions to find an algorithm that can sort, and is faster than the current best one. The number of possible combinations of instructions is similar to the number of particles in the universe or the number of possible combinations of moves in games of chess (10120 games) and Go (10700 games). And a single, wrong move can invalidate the entire algorithm.As the algorithm is built, one instruction at a time, AlphaDev checks that it’s correct by comparing the algorithm’s output with the expected results. For sorting algorithms, this means unordered numbers go in and correctly sorted numbers come out. We reward AlphaDev for both sorting the numbers correctly and for how quickly and efficiently it does so. AlphaDev wins the game by discovering a correct, faster program. Discovering faster sorting algorithmsAlphaDev uncovered new sorting algorithms that led to improvements in the LLVM libc++ sorting library that were up to 70% faster for shorter sequences and about 1.7% faster for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements. We focused on improving sorting algorithms for shorter sequences of three to five elements. These algorithms are among the most widely used because they are often called many times as a part of larger sorting functions. Improving these algorithms can lead to an overall speedup for sorting any number of items.To make the new sorting algorithm more usable for people, we reverse-engineered the algorithms and translated them into C++, one of the most popular coding languages that developers use. These algorithms are now available in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library, used by millions of developers and companies around the world.Finding novel approachesAlphaDev not only found faster algorithms, but also uncovered novel approaches. Its sorting algorithms contain new sequences of instructions that save a single instruction each time they’re applied. This can have a huge impact as these algorithms are used trillions of times a day. We call these ‘AlphaDev swap and copy moves’. This novel approach is reminiscent of AlphaGo’s ‘move 37’ – a counterintuitive play that stunned onlookers and led to the defeat of a legendary Go player. With the swap and copy move, AlphaDev skips over a step to connect items in a way that looks like a mistake but is actually a shortcut. This shows AlphaDev’s ability to uncover original solutions and challenges the way we think about how to improve computer science algorithms.From sorting to hashing in data structuresAfter discovering faster sorting algorithms, we tested whether AlphaDev could generalise and improve a different computer science algorithm: hashing. Hashing is a fundamental algorithm in computing used to retrieve, store, and compress data. Like a librarian who uses a classification system to locate a certain book, hashing algorithms help users know what they’re looking for and exactly where to find it. These algorithms take data for a specific key (e.g. user name “Jane Doe”) and hashes it – a process where raw data is turned into a unique string of characters (e.g 1234ghfty). This hash is used by the computer to retrieve the data related to the key quickly rather than searching all of the data. We applied AlphaDev to one of the most commonly used algorithms for hashing in data structures to try and discover a faster algorithm. And when we applied it to the 9-16 bytes range of the hashing function, the algorithm that AlphaDev discovered was 30% faster. This year, AlphaDev’s new hashing algorithm was released into the open-source Abseil library, available to millions of developers around the world, and we estimate that it’s now being used trillions of times a day. Optimising the world’s code, one algorithm at a timeBy optimising and launching improved sorting and hashing algorithms used by developers all around the world, AlphaDev has demonstrated its ability to generalise and discover new algorithms with real-world impact. We see AlphaDev as a step towards developing general-purpose AI tools that could help optimise the entire computing ecosystem and solve other problems that will benefit society.While optimising in the space of low-level assembly instructions is very powerful, there are limitations as the algorithm grows, and we are currently exploring AlphaDev’s ability to optimise algorithms directly in high-level languages such as C++ which would be more useful for developers.AlphaDev’s discoveries, such as the swap and copy moves, not only show that it can improve algorithms but also find new solutions. We hope these discoveries inspire researchers and developers alike to create techniques and approaches that can further optimise fundamental algorithms to create a more powerful and sustainable computing ecosystem.Learn more about optimising the computing ecosystem:Acknowledgements: Juanita Bawagan, Arielle Bier, Gabriella Pearl, Duncan Smith, Katie McAtackney, Kathryn Seager, Max Barnett, Ross West, Dominic Barlow, Hollie Dobson, Domhnall Malone for their help with text and figures.

While some developers swear by it, others are not convinced. In this article, we will take a closer look at the benefits of using an ORM and the difference between data model and domain model.\\n\\nWhy Use an ORM?\\n\\nOne of the main reasons developers use an ORM is to avoid writing tedious data-access code. ORM frameworks have already implemented and tested the functionality required to interact with databases, such as connection pooling, caching, and transaction management. By using an ORM, developers can focus on writing business logic instead of worrying about low-level database operations.\\n\\nAnother benefit of using an ORM is that it provides automatic mapping between the object model and the database schema. This eliminates the need for manual mapping code, which is prone to errors. ORM frameworks also provide type-safe queries, which can help catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.\\n\\nData Model vs Domain Model\\n\\nWhen using an ORM, it is important to distinguish between the data model and the domain model. The data model represents the database schema, while the domain model represents the business entities and their relationships. The data model is typically created by a database administrator, while the domain model is designed by the developers.\\n\\nIt is important to keep these two models separate, as they serve different purposes. The data model is optimized for storage and retrieval of data, while the domain model is optimized for expressing business logic. By keeping these models separate, developers can avoid coupling the business logic to the database schema, which can make the code more maintainable and easier to test.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, using an ORM can provide significant benefits for developers, such as reducing boilerplate code, automatic mapping, and type-safe queries. However, it is important to keep the data model and domain model separate, to avoid coupling the business logic to the database schema.\\n\\nAs a developer, it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the industry. By keeping an eye on the latest developments in ORM frameworks, developers can ensure that they are using the most efficient and effective tools for their projects."}

It is widely used for building web applications and APIs. GCP Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform that allows you to run your containerized applications with ease. Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application with all its dependencies into a single container. Gitlab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities.\\n\\nIn this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a Flask application on GCP Cloud Run with Docker and Gitlab. We will cover the following topics:\\n\\n1. Setting up a Flask application\\n2. Creating a Dockerfile for your Flask application\\n3. Deploying your Flask application to GCP Cloud Run\\n4. Setting up CI/CD with Gitlab\\n\\nSetting up a Flask application\\n\\nFirst, you need to create a Flask application. You can create a new Flask application by running the following command:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip install flask\\n$ mkdir myapp\\n$ cd myapp\\n$ touch app.py\\n```\\n\\nNext, open the app.py file and add the following code:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flask import Flask\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n@app.route('/')\\ndef hello_world():\\n    return 'Hello, World!'\\n```\\n\\nThis code creates a simple Flask application that returns \\"Hello, World!\\" when you visit the root URL.\\n\\nCreating a Dockerfile for your Flask application\\n\\nNext, you need to create a Dockerfile for your Flask application. The Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Here's an example Dockerfile for a Flask application:\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\n# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\\nFROM python:3.8-slim-buster\\n\\n# Set the working directory to /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app\\nCOPY . /app\\n\\n# Install the required packages\\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container\\nEXPOSE 8080\\n\\n# Define environment variable\\nENV NAME World\\n\\n# Run app.py when the container launches\\nCMD [\\"python\\", \\"app.py\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThis Dockerfile starts with an official Python 3.8 image, sets the working directory to /app, copies the contents of the current directory into the container, installs the required packages, exposes port 8080, sets an environment variable, and runs the app.py file when the container launches.\\n\\nDeploying your Flask application to GCP Cloud Run\\n\\nNow that you have created a Dockerfile for your Flask application, you can deploy it to GCP Cloud Run. Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. Install the Google Cloud SDK\\n2. Build the Docker image\\n3. Push the Docker image to Google Container Registry\\n4. Deploy the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run\\n\\nHere's an example command to build the Docker image:\\n\\n```\\n$ docker build -t myapp .\\n```\\n\\nThis command builds a Docker image with the tag \\"myapp\\".\\n\\nNext, you need to push the Docker image to Google Container Registry. Here's an example command:\\n\\n```\\n$ docker tag myapp gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n$ docker push gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n```\\n\\nThis command tags the Docker image with the registry name and pushes it to Google Container Registry.\\n\\nFinally, you can deploy the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run. Here's an example command:\\n\\n```\\n$ gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/myproject/myapp --platform managed\\n```\\n\\nThis command deploys the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run on the managed platform.\\n\\nSetting up CI/CD with Gitlab\\n\\nNow that you have deployed your Flask application to GCP Cloud Run, you can set up CI/CD with Gitlab. Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. Create a Gitlab repository for your Flask application\\n2. Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root directory of your repository\\n3. Define the stages and jobs for your CI/CD pipeline\\n4. Add the CI/CD variables to your Gitlab project\\n\\nHere's an example .gitlab-ci.yml file:\\n\\n```yaml\\nimage: docker:latest\\n\\nservices:\\n  - docker:dind\\n\\nstages:\\n  - build\\n  - test\\n  - deploy\\n\\nbuild:\\n  stage: build\\n  script:\\n    - docker build -t myapp .\\n    - docker tag myapp gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n    - echo \\"$GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT\\" > /tmp/key.json\\n    - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file /tmp/key.json\\n    - gcloud config set project myproject\\n    - gcloud auth configure-docker\\n    - docker push gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n\\ntest:\\n  stage: test\\n  script:\\n    - echo \\"Running tests\\"\\n\\ndeploy:\\n  stage: deploy\\n  script:\\n    - gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/myproject/myapp --platform managed\\n```\\n\\nThis .gitlab-ci.yml file defines three stages: build, test, and deploy. The build stage builds the Docker image, tags it, and pushes it to Google Container Registry. The test stage runs any tests that you have defined. The deploy stage deploys the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run.\\n\\nFinally, you need to add the CI/CD variables to your Gitlab project. Here are the variables that you need to add:\\n\\n- GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: The JSON key for your GCP service account\\n- GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID: The ID of your GCP project\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this guide, we have shown you how to set up a Flask application on GCP Cloud Run with Docker and Gitlab. We have covered the basics of Flask, Docker, and GCP Cloud Run, and we have shown you how to deploy your application to GCP Cloud Run and set up CI/CD with Gitlab. We hope that this guide has been helpful to you and that you are now ready to build your own Flask application on GCP Cloud Run with Docker and Gitlab."}

As demand for computation grows, it has become critical for these algorithms to be as performant as possible. Whereas remarkable progress has been achieved in the past2, making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library3. This change to this part of the sort library represents the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We also present results in extra domains, showcasing the generality of the approach. MainHuman intuition and know-how have been crucial in improving algorithms. However, many algorithms have reached a stage whereby human experts have not been able to optimize them further, leading to an ever-growing computational bottleneck. The work in classical program synthesis literature, spanning many decades, aims to generate correct programs and/or optimize programs using proxies for latency. These include enumerative search techniques4,5,6,7 and stochastic search5,6,8,9,10 as well as the more recent trend of using deep learning in program synthesis for generating correct programs11,12,13,14,15,16. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we can take this a step further by generating correct and performant algorithms by optimizing for actual measured latency at the CPU instruction level, by more efficiently searching and considering the space of correct and fast programs compared to previous work.One of the fundamental questions in computer science is how to sort a sequence17,18,19,20. This is taught in elementary computer science classes around the world21,22 and is used ubiquitously by a vast range of applications23,24,25. Decades of computer science research have focused on discovering and optimizing sorting algorithms26,27,28. A key component of practical solutions is a small sort over a short sequence of elements; this algorithm is called repeatedly when sorting large arrays that use divide-and-conquer approaches29. In this work, we focus on two types of small sort algorithm: (1) the fixed sort and (2) the variable sort. Fixed sort algorithms sort sequences of a fixed length (for example, sort 3 can only sort sequences of length 3), whereas variable sort algorithms can sort a sequence of varying size (for example, variable sort 5 can sort sequences ranging from one to five elements).We formulate the problem of discovering new, efficient sorting algorithms as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. In this game, the player selects a series of low-level CPU instructions, which we refer to as assembly instructions30, to combine to yield a new and efficient sorting algorithm. This is challenging as the player needs to consider the combinatorial space of assembly instructions to yield an algorithm that is both provably correct and fast. The hardness of the AssemblyGame arises not only from the size of the search space, which is similar to extremely challenging games such as chess (10120 games)31 and Go (10700 games)32, but also from the nature of the reward function. A single incorrect instruction in the AssemblyGame can potentially invalidate the entire algorithm, making exploration in this space of games incredibly challenging.To play the game, we introduce AlphaDev, a learning agent that is trained to search for correct and efficient algorithms. This agent is comprised of two core components, namely (1) a learning algorithm and (2) a representation function. The AlphaDev learning algorithm can incorporate both DRL as well as stochastic search optimization algorithms to play AssemblyGame. The primary learning algorithm in AlphaDev is an extension of AlphaZero33, a well-known DRL algorithm, in which a neural network is trained to guide a search to solve AssemblyGame. The representation function is interchangeable and captures the underlying structure of assembly programs. The primary AlphaDev representation is based on Transformers34.Using AlphaDev, we have discovered fixed and variable sort algorithms from scratch that are both new and more efficient than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks. The fixed sort solutions for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 discovered by AlphaDev have been integrated into the standard sort function in the LLVM standard C++ library3. This library is used by several million users including universities and numerous international companies35. In addition, we analyse the new algorithm discoveries, compare AlphaDev to stochastic search optimization approaches and apply AlphaDev to further domains to showcase the generality of the approach.Representing algorithms as low-level CPU instructionsWhen compiling algorithms to machine code from a high level language such as C++ (for example, the sorting function in Fig. 1a), the algorithm is first compiled into assembly (Fig. 1b). The assembler then converts the assembly program into executable machine code. In this work, we optimize algorithms at the assembly level30. In a typical assembly program, the values are copied from memory into registers, manipulated between registers and then written back to memory. The set of assembly instructions supported depends on the processor architecture. For the purposes of this work, we focus on a subset of assembly instructions supported by the x86 processor architecture using the AT&T syntax36. Each instruction is of the format Opcode⟨OperandA, OperandB⟩. An example instruction is mov, which is defined as move a value from source (A) to destination (B). Further instruction definitions such as compare (cmp), conditional move (cmovX) and jump (jX) can be found in Extended Data Table 1. In the example in Fig. 1b, %eax, %ecx, %edx, %edi correspond to four different register locations and (%rsi), 4(%rsi) correspond to two different memory locations. The symbol $2 is a placeholder for a constant value, which corresponds to the length of the vector in this example. We use the terms assembly program and assembly algorithm interchangeably in this work. This is because AlphaDev builds an assembly program from scratch, from an initially unordered set of instructions, each time it plays AssemblyGame, defining a new and efficient algorithm.Fig. 1: The relationship between C++ and assembly programs.a, A C++ implementation of a variable sort 2 function that sorts any input sequence of up to two elements. b, The C++ implementation in a is compiled to this equivalent low-level assembly representation.Full size imageDRL for discovering faster algorithmsIn this section, we formulate optimizing algorithms at the CPU instruction level as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem37, in which the environment is modelled as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. Each state in this game is defined as a vector St = ⟨Pt, Zt⟩ where Pt is a representation of the algorithm generated thus far in the game and Zt represents the state of memory and registers after executing the current algorithm on a set of predefined inputs. As seen in Fig. 2a, at timestep t, the player receives the current state St and executes an action at. This involves appending a legal assembly instruction (for example, mov<A,B>) to the current algorithm generated thus far. A reward rtis received that comprises both a measure of algorithm correctness and latency. Algorithm correctness (Fig. 2b) involves inputting a set of N test sequences into the current algorithm Pt to generate N outputs. These outputs are then compared to the expected outputs and a correctness reward rt is computed. Latency rewards can be generated by either (1) penalizing the agent for increasing the length of the algorithm (when length and latency are highly correlated) that we refer to as the algorithm length reward, or (2) measuring the actual latency of the algorithm. The game is executed for a limited number of steps, after which the game is terminated. Winning the game corresponds to generating a correct, low-latency algorithm using assembly instructions. Losing the game corresponds to generating an incorrect algorithm or a correct but inefficient algorithm.Fig. 2: The AssemblyGame and algorithm correctness computation.a, The AssemblyGame is played by AlphaDev, which receives as input the current assembly algorithm generated thus far St and plays the game by selecting an action to execute. In this example, the action is a mov<Register0,Memory1> assembly instruction, which is appended to the current algorithm. The agent receives a reward that is a function of the algorithm’s correctness, discussed in b, as well as the algorithm’s latency. The game is won by the player discovering a low latency, correct algorithm. b, The program correctness and latency computations are used to compute the reward rt. In this example, test sequences are input to the algorithm; for example, in the case of sorting three elements, test inputs comprise all sequences of unsorted elements of length 3. For each sequence, the algorithm output is compared to the expected output (in the case of sorting, the expected output is the sorted elements). In this example, the output \\({\\bf{D}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) does not match the expected output \\({\\bf{B}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) and the algorithm is therefore incorrect.Full size imageWe refer to the agent that plays this single-player game as AlphaDev. The agent’s primary learning algorithm is an extension of the AlphaZero agent32 and guides a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) planning procedure using a deep neural network33,38. The input to the neural network is the state St and the output is a policy and value prediction. The policy prediction is a distribution over actions and the value function is a prediction of the cumulative returns R that the agent should expect to receive from the current state St. During a game, the agent receives as input the current state St. The agent then executes an MCTS procedure and uses this to select the next action to take. The generated games are then used to update the network’s parameters, enabling the agent to learn.It is critical that AlphaDev has a representation39,40 capable of representing complex algorithmic structures to efficiently explore the space of instructions. To achieve this, we introduce the AlphaDev representation network (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This network comprises two components, namely (1) a transformer encoder network that provides the agent with a representation of the algorithm structure, and (2) the CPU state encoder network that helps the agent predict how the algorithm affects the dynamics of memory and registers. The CPU state encoder network comprises a multilayer perceptron that receives as input the state of each register and memory location for a given set of inputs. These networks each output embeddings that are combined to yield the AlphaDev state representation.Transformer encoderTransformers are natural text encoders and have had much success with language models recently14,34,41. As such, this motivated us to adapt the standard transformer to model assembly instructions. We developed and incorporated a transformer encoder, our adaptation of the MultiQuery transformer encoder42, into the AlphaDev representation network to represent the assembly instructions. Each assembly instruction’s Opcode and corresponding Operands are converted to one-hot encodings and concatenated to form the raw input sequence. This is fed through a multilayer transformer encoder, which maps it to corresponding embedding vectors (see Extended Data Fig. 1b for an illustration).Latency value functionsLatency is an important reward signal that is used to guide the agent in discovering performant algorithms. To better estimate latency, we implemented a dual value function setup, whereby AlphaDev has two value function heads: one predicting algorithm correctness and the second predicting algorithm latency. The latency head is used to directly predict the latency of a given program by using the program’s actual computed latency as a Monte Carlo target for AlphaDev during training. This dual-head approach achieved substantially better results than the vanilla, single head value function setup when optimizing for real latency.ResultsDiscovering faster sort algorithmsWe trained the AlphaDev agent from scratch to generate a range of fixed sort and variable sort algorithms that are both correct and achieve lower latency than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks.Fixed sorting algorithmsWe considered three fundamental algorithms: sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The state-of-the-art human benchmarks for these algorithms are sorting networks43 as they generate efficient, conditional branchless assembly code. This means that all instructions are executed sequentially and there is no branching involved. Improving on these algorithms is challenging as they are already highly optimized. As seen in Table 1a, AlphaDev is able to find algorithms with fewer instructions than the human benchmarks for sort 3 and sort 5 and matches the state-of-the-art performance on sort 4. These shorter algorithms do indeed lead to lower latency as the algorithm length and latency are correlated for the conditional branchless case; see Appendix B in Supplementary Information for more details. We also explored scaling to slightly larger sorts using a variant of AlphaDev. We managed to save three instructions on sort 6, two instructions on sort 7 and one instruction on sort 8, which provides a promising basis for future work. See Appendix C in Supplementary Information for an overview of the approach.Table 1 AlphaDev performance when optimizing for algorithm length and latencyFull size tableVariable sorting algorithmsWe considered three variable sorting algorithms: VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5. The human benchmark in each case is defined as an algorithm that, for a given input length, calls the corresponding sorting network. In this case, branching is required, which greatly increases the complexity of the problem as the agent needs to (1) determine how many subalgorithms it needs to construct and (2) build the body of the main algorithm in parallel. The agent may also need to call subalgorithms from other subalgorithms. In this case, optimizing for length leads to significantly shorter algorithms compared to the human benchmarks as seen in Table 1a. However, owing to the complexities introduced by branching, latency and length are not always correlated; see Supplementary Information for more details. As such, we implemented a procedure that measures the actual latency of the programs by taking the fifth percentile of latency measurements across 100 different machines, with computed confidence intervals44, and optimize this metric. See Methods for the full benchmarking setup. When optimizing for latency, the agent improves significantly on the human benchmarks in each case as seen in Table 1b.New algorithm discoveriesThe solutions discovered by AlphaDev include new and exciting algorithmic discoveries that lead to more efficient performance. In the fixed sort setting, we found that AlphaDev discovered two interesting sequences of instructions that, when applied to a sorting network algorithm, reduce the algorithm by one assembly instruction each time. We refer to each sequence of instructions as (1) the AlphaDev swap move and (2) the AlphaDev copy move respectively.AlphaDev swap moveFigure 3a presents an optimal sorting network for three elements (see Methods for an overview of sorting networks). We will explain how AlphaDev has improved the circled network segment. There are many variants of this structure that are found in sorting networks of various sizes, and the same argument applies in each case. The circled part of the network (last two comparators) can be seen as a sequence of instructions that takes an input sequence ⟨A, B, C⟩ and transforms each input as shown in Table 2a (left). However, a comparator on wires B and C precedes this operator and therefore input sequences where B ≤ C are guaranteed. This means that it is enough to compute min(A, B) as the first output instead of min(A, B, C) as shown in Table 2a (right). The pseudocode difference between Fig. 3b,c demonstrates how the AlphaDev swap move saves one instruction each time it is applied.Fig. 3: Sorting networks and algorithmic improvements discovered by AlphaDev.a, An optimal classic sorting network for three inputs. The circled comparators have been improved by AlphaDev. See the AlphaDev swap move for more details. b,c, The assembly pseudocode before applying the AlphaDev swap move (b) and after applying the AlphaDev swap move (c), resulting in the removal of a single instruction. d, An optimal classic sorting network comparator configuration that has been improved by AlphaDev. See the AlphaDev copy move for more details. e,f, The assembly pseudocode before applying the AlphaDev copy move (e) and after applying the AlphaDev copy move (f), resulting in the removal of a single instruction.Full size imageTable 2 Analysis of the AlphaDev swap and copy movesFull size tableAlphaDev copy moveFigure 3d presents a sorting network configuration, consisting of three comparators, that is applied across four wires. This configuration is found in a sort 8 sorting network and corresponds to an operator taking four inputs ⟨A, B, C, D⟩ and transforming them into four outputs as seen in Table 2b (on the left). One can show that as part of sort 8, the input that flows into the operator satisfies the following inequality: \\({\\rm{D}}\\ge \\min ({\\rm{A}},{\\rm{C}})\\). This means that the operator can be improved by applying the AlphaDev copy move that is defined in Table 2b (on the right), resulting in one instruction less than the original operator. The code difference between the original operator and the code after applying the AlphaDev copy move is visualized in Fig. 3e,f, respectively.New variable sort algorithmsThe VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev is particularly interesting. The flow diagram for the human benchmark algorithm and AlphaDev can be seen in Fig. 4a,b, respectively. The human benchmark algorithm determines the length of the input vector, and then calls the corresponding sorting network to sort the elements. The AlphaDev solution has a completely different approach as seen in Fig. 4b. If the length of the input vector is strictly greater than 2, then sort 3 is immediately called, resulting in the first three elements being sorted. If the vector is greater than three elements, then a simplified sort 4 algorithm is called that sorts the remaining unsorted elements in the input vector. It is this simplified part of the routine that yields significant gains in terms of algorithmic length and latency.Fig. 4: Fundamentally different algorithms discovered by AlphaDev.a, A flow diagram of the variable sort 4 (VarSort4) human benchmark algorithm. In this algorithm, a sequence of unsorted numbers are input into the algorithm. If the sequence length is four, three or two numbers, then the corresponding sort 4, sort 3 or sort 2 sorting network is called that sorts the resulting sequence. The result is then returned and output by the function. b, The VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev. This algorithm also receives sequences of length four, three or two numbers as input. In this case, if the length is two, then it calls the sort 2 sorting network and returns. If the length is three then it calls sort 3 to sort the first three numbers and returns. If, however, the length is greater than three, then it calls sort 3, followed by a simplified sort 4 routine that sorts the remaining unsorted number. It is this part of the routine that results in significant latency savings.Full size imageStochastic search optimization approachesIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8, adapted it to the sort setting and used it as the learning algorithm in AlphaDev. We refer to this variant as AlphaDev-S (see Methods for more details). We run this algorithm with at least the same amount of resources and wall-clock time as AlphaDev. AlphaDev-S requires a prohibitive amount of time to optimize directly for latency as latency needs to be computed after every mutation. As such, AlphaDev-S optimizes for a latency proxy, namely algorithm length and, then, at the end of training, we search through all correct programs generated by AlphaDev-S and benchmark each one to find the lowest latency solution. In general, we find that AlphaDev consistently outperforms AlphaDev-S when learning from scratch without previous knowledge. In addition, as the size of the program increases, AlphaDev explores orders of magnitude fewer programs (12 million programs in the worst case) compared to AlphaDev-S (31 trillion programs in the worst case). This may be because AlphaDev is able to better explore the space of algorithms compared to the breadth-first stochastic search procedure that gets stuck more easily into local optima; see Methods for an overview of this exploration hypothesis. In addition, AlphaDev never evaluates latency during search as it uses the latency value function predictions and, because of this, only needs to compute actual measured latency on less than 0.002% of generated programs. When incorporating previous knowledge into AlphaDev-S, such as warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal solution, AlphaDev-S is more computationally efficient for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 (branchless assembly algorithms) and also generates competitive low-latency algorithms to that of AlphaDev in each case. However, for algorithms that require branching (if–else statements), in which algorithm length and latency are not well correlated, AlphaDev discovers lower latency solutions than AlphaDev-S, even when warm starting this algorithm with a near-optimal solution. See Methods for an in-depth analysis of these algorithms.Generalization to additional domainsTo test the generality of AlphaDev, we train the agent on a set of additional domains. These include a protocol buffer deserialization subroutine called VarInt, presented below, and a competitive coding problem (see Appendix D in Supplementary Information for more details). The competitive coding domain latency performance is reported in Table 1b.Protocol Buffer is Google’s open-source data format used to serialize structured data45. This format is commonly used in cases in which performance or network load is of primary concern. The VarInt algorithm46 is a key component in both the serialization and deserialization processes. We trained the AlphaDev agent as in variable sort to optimize the VarInt deserialization function with respect to correctness and measured latency. For correctness, we reward the agent for correctly deserializing each input. We use a set of 80 inputs and corresponding outputs that cover common protobuf use cases. AlphaDev learns an optimized VarInt deserialization function and manages to significantly outperform the human benchmark for single valued inputs. Our agent discovers a branchless solution that is both shorter (Table 1a) and roughly three times faster than the human benchmark (Table 1b). In doing so, the agent also discovered a new VarInt assignment move in which AlphaDev learns to combine two operations into a single instruction leading to latency savings. See Appendix D.1 in Supplementary Information for a full overview of this move. This is a strong indication that AlphaDev is capable of generalizing to optimize non-trivial, real-world algorithms.Libc++ sort patchThe sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library are called many times by larger sorting algorithms and are therefore fundamental components of the library. We reverse engineered the low-level assembly sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 to C++ and discovered that our sort implementations led to improvements of up to 70% for sequences of a length of five and roughly 1.7% for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements. These improvements are for the uint32, uint64 and float data types for ARMv8, Intel Skylake and AMD Zen 2 CPU architectures; see Appendix E in Supplementary Information for the full performance tables. The performance improvements are due to both the branchless conditional assembly generated by AlphaDev as well as the new AlphaDev swap move. For sort 5, we used a 43 length algorithm discovered by AlphaDev, as it led to a more efficient C++ implementation. These algorithms were sent for review and have officially been included in the libc++ standard sorting library3. It is the first change to these sub-routines in over a decade. This is also the first time that any component in this sort library has been replaced by an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We estimate that these routines are being called trillions of times every day1,35,47.DiscussionAlphaDev discovers new, state-of-the-art sorting algorithms from scratch that have been incorporated into the LLVM C++ library, used by millions of developers and applications around the world23,24,25. Both AlphaDev and stochastic search are powerful algorithms. An interesting direction for future research is to investigate combining these algorithms together to realize the complementary advantages of both approaches.It is important to note that AlphaDev can, in theory, generalize to functions that do not require exhaustive verification of test cases. For example, hashing functions48 as well as cryptographic hashing functions49 define function correctness by the number of hashing collisions. Therefore, in this case, AlphaDev can optimize for minimizing collisions as well as latency. AlphaDev can also, in theory, optimize complicated logic components within the body of large, impressive functions. We hope that AlphaDev can provide interesting insights and inspire new approaches in both the artificial intelligence and program synthesis communities.MethodsBackgroundAlphaZeroAlphaZero33 is an RL algorithm that leverages MCTS as a policy improvement operator. It consists of (1) a representation network frep that outputs a latent representation ht of the state St; and (2) a prediction network fpred that predicts the expected return (the value) \\({\\hat{v}}_{t}\\) and a policy (that is, distribution over the action space) \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) from a given latent state. The algorithm uses the true dynamics and reward when planning. MuZero38 is a model-based variant of AlphaZero that has the same representation and prediction networks, but also learns a model of the dynamics and predicts rewards, which it uses for planning. Specifically, it learns a dynamics network fdyn that predicts the next latent state \\({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) and reward \\({\\hat{r}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) resulting from a transition. Note that the subscript t denotes timesteps in the real environment and the superscript k represents timesteps in the model.$${{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}={f}^{rep}({{\\bf{\\text{S}}}}_{t})$$ (1) $${{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k+1},\\,{\\hat{r}}_{t}^{k+1}={f}^{dyn}({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k},{{\\bf{\\text{a}}}}_{t}^{k})$$ (2) $${\\hat{v}}_{t},\\,{\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}={f}^{pred}({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t})$$ (3) On reaching a new state, AlphaZero proceeds by first encoding the state into a latent representation with the representation network. Then, the true dynamics or dynamics network (for MuZero) as well as the prediction network fpred(ht) are used to simulate several trajectories that fill out a search tree, by sampling state transitions. At each node, the actions are selected using an optimistic strategy called the predictor upper confidence tree bound32, meant to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (progressing further down the subtree of the current estimate of the best action). This strategy starts out by following the predicted policy \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) closely, and gradually shifts towards maximizing the predicted value function. Ultimately, an action is recommended by sampling from the root node with probability proportional to its visit count during MCTS. The predicted policy is then trained to match the visit counts of the MCTS policy in an attempt to distil the search procedure into a policy such that subsequent iterations of MCTS will disregard nodes that are not promising.Sorting networksSorting networks are very efficient as their structures can be parallelized on modern CPU architectures. They therefore tend to achieve faster runtime performance, especially on small sorts, compared to popular and efficient base case algorithms such as insertion sort17,43,50. A sorting network43 consists of two types of item called comparators (vertical lines) and wires (horizontal lines) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Each wire carries a value from left to right. When two wires intersect at a comparator, the values on the two wires are compared. If the value of the bottom wire is smaller than the value of the top wire, then the values are swapped between wires as seen in Extended Data Fig. 2b. A programmatic implementation of a sorting network consists of executing these swaps on particular pairs of elements from the input sequence in a particular order.Action pruning rulesWe pruned the action space by removing some program invariances (for example, the order of register allocation) and illegal instructions (for example, comparing two memory locations). This helps reducing the size of the action space and increases convergence rate. For our experiments, we used the following rules: (1) Memory locations are always read in incremental order. (2) Registers are allocated in incremental order. (3) We cannot compare or conditionally move to a memory location (illegal). (4) We can read and write to each memory location only once. (5) We cannot use non-initialized registers (illegal). (6) Do not perform consecutive compare instructions. Training regimeWe train AlphaDev on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v.3, with a total batch size of 1,024 per TPU core. We use up to 16 TPU cores and train for 1 million iterations. On the actor side, the games are played on standalone TPU v.4, and we use up to 512 actors. In practice, across all tasks, training takes, in the worst case, 2 days to converge.AlphaDev-SIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other possible approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8 and incorporated it into AlphaDev as the learning algorithm to optimize sorting functions. We refer to this adapted version as AlphaDev-S. Our re-implementation has been specifically optimized for the sorting domain. This includes implementing the algorithm to run with our assembly environment, defining a correctness and performance loss function specific to sorting and running extensive hyperparameter sweeps to identify the best variant. The cost function used for AlphaDev-S is c = correctness + α × performance where correctness corresponds to computing the number of incorrect input sequence elements that are still unsorted, performance corresponds to the algorithm length reward and α is a weight trading off the two cost functions. We are unable to optimize directly for latency as this slows down the learning algorithm considerably making learning infeasible. It should be noted that this function has been adapted to support the same set of assembly instructions used by AlphaDev as well as prune the same set of incorrect or illegal actions. It also uses the same program correctness computation module (Fig. 2b) to compute the correctness term.AlphaDev-S is then executed by first proposing a transformation to the program stored in the buffer (which may be empty or initialized with an already sorted program). The correctness and performance terms are then computed using the program correctness module and algorithm length, respectively. If the cost is lower than the current best cost, the new program is accepted with high probability, otherwise it is rejected. We will now discuss the correctness cost function and transform weights in more detail.Correctness costFor the correctness cost function, we implemented three types of cost function. The first one is defined as the percentage of incorrectly placed items: \\(\\frac{P-P{C}_{t}}{P}\\) where P is the total number of items to place and PCt is number of correctly placed items at timestep t. The second variant is the square root of this equation. The final cost function takes the square root of the difference \\(\\sqrt{-{PC}_{t}}\\) and this is what yielded the best performance.Program transformationsWe enabled several program transformations such as adding an instruction to increase the size of the program (Add Transform), swapping two instructions (Swap Transform), randomly changing an Opcode for an instruction (Opcode Transform), randomly sampling an Operand for a chosen instruction (Operand Transform) and randomly sample an Opcode and its corresponding Operands (Instruction Transform). It is possible to influence the sampling of these transforms to encourage some to be sampled more or less frequently. We optimized the weights for sampling transforms by running an extensive hyperparameter sweep.Investigative studies for AlphaDev variantsWe now present a set of investigative studies that help to better understand the advantages and limitations of the DRL and the stochastic search learning algorithms used in AlphaDev. We compare AlphaDev to AlphaDev-S. We implemented two variants of AlphaDev-S: (1) Cold Start (AlphaDev-S-CS) and (2) Warm Start (AlphaDev-S-WS). AlphaDev-S-CS uses no previous information and has to generate a program from an empty program buffer. AlphaDev-S-WS’s buffer is warm started with a correct sorting program (for example, optimal sorting network assembly program) and it edits the program to optimize it further. We compared the variants with AlphaDev in both the individual and variable sort algorithm setups.Because AlphaDev always learns from scratch with no previous knowledge, the direct comparison would be to the cold start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-CS. However, as initial near-optimal programs may sometimes be available, we also compare AlphaDev to the warm start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-WS.It should be noted that the stochastic search variants are unable to optimize directly for latency, as this would make learning infeasible because of computational efficiency. As such, our AlphaDev-S variants optimize for algorithm length. Then, at the end of training, we iterate through the set of generated programs for AlphaDev-S across varying lengths and identify the program with the lowest latency.In each case, the stochastic search algorithms (AlphaDev-S) are run using at least the same computational resources and wall-clock time to that of AlphaDev.Fixed sortWe first examine the performance of the various approaches for the fixed sort algorithms. In this case, all algorithmic variants optimize for algorithm length as algorithm length and latency are highly correlated in the conditional branchless setting (see Supplementary Information for more details).In the cold start setting, AlphaDev-S-CS is unable to find the optimal programs in each case as seen in Extended Data Table 2a. In addition, AlphaDev-S-CS explores orders of magnitude more programs than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. In the warm start setting, AlphaDev-S is warm started with a near-optimal sorted program, and is able to match the performance of AlphaDev in each case as shown in Extended Data Table 2a. It is more computationally efficient than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2c but explores orders of magnitude more programs for sort 3 and sort 5 as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. It can be argued that AlphaDev-S-WS has a substantial advantage in this scenario as it is provided with an initial near-optimal program. We will show in the Variable sort section that when the algorithms become more complicated and branching is introduced, warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal program is not enough and can cause it to get stuck in suboptimal solutions.Brute-force approachWe also used a brute-force approach to prove that no program shorter than 17 instructions exists for sort 3. We had to enumerate roughly 1032 programs and, even with pruning heuristics, it took more than 3 days to prove this hypothesis. For sort 4 and above this approach is infeasible.Latency benchmarking suiteThe length of a program is only a proxy for the performance of an algorithm. As we introduce branching structures, the length and latency of a program are not well correlated. Therefore, we run the programs on actual machines and measure their latency. Microbenchmarking is very challenging given the numerous noise sources that could affect the measurements. This is especially true when running on shared machines where there could be interference from other processes. Our approach is to have a separate benchmarking service, replicated on separated machines, so that we can quickly perform many measurements in a controlled environment under different conditions. The system works as follows: (1) The RL agent processes 1,000 measurements across the machines using the replicated service. (2) For each measurement, the service runs the given sorting algorithm over 10,000 random inputs (for example, for sort 3 this would be 3 × 10,000 = 30,000 random integers). (3) We measure the time taken using a CPU performance counter (CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.CORE). We then take the fifth percentile as our final measurement, because we assume that most noise sources are one-sided (for example, cache misses, pre-emptions and so on). During training we process the measurements across ten machines for computational efficiency. After training, we benchmark AlphaDev’s solution against the baseline solutions, and process the measurements across 100 machines for more accuracy and noise reduction. For each benchmark, we compute confidence intervals using the distribution-free two-sided confidence interval for a quantile tabular method44.Variable sortWhen optimizing directly for latency, AlphaDev outperforms AlphaDev-S-WS on VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5 as seen in Extended Data Table 3a. AlphaDev-S-CS fails to find a solution in each case. In the cases of VarSort4 and VarSort5, program length and latency are not correlated (see Supplementary Information for more details). This indicates that when program length cannot be used as a proxy for performance, AlphaDev is able to find lower latency solutions compared to AlphaDev-S. This is even in the case where the stochastic search is warm started with a near-optimal program. In addition, AlphaDev converges to the optimal solution after exploring a maximum of 12M programs as seen in Extended Data Table 3b. This is orders of magnitude lower than that of AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively (31 trillion programs in the worst case).Exploration hypothesisWe proposed that AlphaDev-S struggles to discover programs when learning from scratch and gets stuck in local optima when warm started because of its limited exploration capabilities as a result of the stochastic search procedure. Extended Data Fig. 3 shows two-dimensional t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) projections51 of AlphaDev and AlphaDev-S’s assembly algorithms discovered during their respective training procedures for VarSort5. The features used in the projection include correctness, latency, algorithm length and a histogram count of the instructions used per algorithm. Extended Data Fig. 3a indicates the regions in algorithm space explored by AlphaDev, AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively, whereas Extended Data Fig. 3b superimposes algorithm correctness onto each point in the t-SNE projection in which the colour indicates the correctness of each discovered algorithm, ranging from incorrect algorithms (purple) to correct algorithms (yellow). The AlphaDev-S variants both cover a densely packed circular region around their initial seed, which highlights the breadth-first nature of their stochastic search procedure. This illustrates that AlphaDev-S-CS fails to navigate through the space of incorrect algorithms in a reasonable amount of time and discover correct algorithms when learning from scratch. A similar argument applies to AlphaDev-S-WS whereby, when optimizing from an already correct but suboptimal expert demonstration, the algorithm is biased towards exploring its vicinity and struggles to escape this local maxima. By contrast, AlphaDev has more diverse algorithm space coverage, as the long-term value function is a guiding signal for discovering new and interesting parts of algorithm space. As seen in Extended Data Fig. 3b, it is capable of escaping the space of incorrect algorithms to discover a new space of correct algorithms, highlighting the exploration advantages afforded by AlphaDev.Related workAssembly optimizationThere are numerous approaches to optimizing assembly programs, which we have classified into three groups: enumerative search, stochastic search and symbolic search5.First, enumerative search techniques include brute-force program enumeration4,5,6 as well as implicit enumeration using symbolic theorem proving52,53. These approaches search through the space of programs to find a solution based on a predefined set of programs, heuristic and/or cost function. These approaches struggle to span large regions of program space, especially as the size and complexity of the program increases.Second, stochastic search techniques circumvent comprehensive enumeration by relying on sampling mechanisms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling5,6,8,9. Rajeev Alur et al.5 define a correctness specification, provided by a logical formula that uses symbols from a background theory. The goal is to then find an implementation expression such that logical formula defining the specification is valid. The idea is to iteratively add test cases and then search and expand the program to solve the given test cases. They optimize for correctness on problems from the book Hacker’s delight54. Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana et al.6 introduce the LENS algorithm that is based on running enumerative, stochastic and symbolic search in parallel, while relying on handcrafted pruning rules. This setup is capable of optimizing up to 21 instructions, and cannot optimize for latency nor support branching. Another algorithm8 is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo rejection sampling and applies transformations to programs in assembly using a loss function that is a function of correctness and performance. Many of these approaches are prone to getting stuck in local minima and may also struggle as the size and/or complexity of the program increases. In addition, incorporating actual, measured latency into these approaches are either infeasible or prohibitively expensive.Third, symbolic search approaches can also be implemented to optimize assembly programs. These include SAT solvers55, SMT solvers5,6 and Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs)56,57. However, these approaches suffer from scaling issues. For example, classical solvers require a problem to be translated into a certain canonical form. It usually requires an expert in the said solvers and a substantial amount of time to find an efficient formulation. In addition, for any new modification of the problem, this has to be repeated. Classical solvers are also hard to parallelize and thus, it is challenging to leverage more hardware to speed up the solving process. Another symbolic search algorithm is Cholorphyll10 that implements a multi-phase approach. It first requires as input a source program with partition annotations that specify where code and data reside. Then, a layout synthesizer maps program fragments onto physical cores to minimize computational costs. The code is then separated into per-core program fragments and the program fragments are compiled into machine code. At this point, a superoptimizer optimizes each of these fragments.SIMD optimizationVarious approaches58,59,60 have also been applied to sorting functions that run in the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)61 setup. This setup is capable of parallelizing instruction execution, but is not supported at present in popular libraries such as LLVM’s libc++ std::sort library. One example is that from Gilles Barthe et al.7 that proposes a methodology for optimizing programs by automatically vectorizing loops with SIMD instructions. They do this by introducing a framework for verifying the correctness of transformations to a program and performing a search-based procedure using the said transformation. Their framework can discover SIMD looping structures of up to nine instructions in 0.12 s, which corresponds to a minimum 2× speed-up.RL approaches for program synthesisThere are also several studies using RL for program optimization. Kevin Ellis et al.62 learn a policy and value function to write and evaluate code, as well as performing a Monte Carlo-style search strategy during inference. This work requires a pretraining step and aims to generate correct programs that satisfy a predefined specification. The approach is successfully applied to computer-aided design and string editing programs. SuperSonic63 uses an RL meta-optimizer to select between different RL architectures, using a Multi-Armed Bandit policy search to find a state representation, reward function and RL algorithm that is optimal for the current task. This requires keeping track of many RL algorithms and architectures, which are used as part of the state space. By contrast, our approach only focuses on training a single RL architecture, taking advantage of MCTS search and powerful state representations. Shypula et al.64 create a supervised assembly dataset and use it to train a Transformer model for mapping unoptimized to optimized code, followed by an RL stage for improving the solution quality. Our method does not require a supervised dataset or two separate training and finetuning stages, and optimizes everything end-to-end using RL and search instead. Chen et al.65 define their own domain specific language and perform input–output program synthesis that better uses the intermediate program representation to guide the synthesis routine. They show that this can be incorporated with RL, using the setup of Rudy Bunel et al.66 and improve the correctness of generated functions. They do not, however, optimize for program length or latency.Input–output examples for program synthesisA large body of work addresses the problem of learning programs from input–output pairs. One type of approach learns a neural network for matching inputs to outputs directly11,13,67,68. This approach is difficult to integrate into existing libraries and can struggle to generalize to previously unseen inputs, although there has been some encouraging recent progress using graph representations69. Another type of approach is to perform a search in program space, guided by a learned model12,70,71,72. For instance, Chen et al.70 use a model that predicts the next program token on the basis of a partial program and the input–output pairs. This bears some similarities to how search is guided in our approach: the learned policy prior in AlphaZero is a model for predicting the next token, learned on the basis of a combination of a partial program and that program’s effects on the inputs. However, we are interested in finding correct and efficient programs, which we achieve by further learning a value function for approximating the expected latency of partial programs, and using AlphaZero to incorporate this value function into the search process.Deep learning for code generationThere are also several deep learning approaches that use large languages models to generate code. These approaches vary in their uses from transpilation, code refactoring and explaining code15 to generating human-level competitive code using a natural language description14. That particular work aims to generate correct code, but does not focus on generating low-latency solutions.Sort-based program optimizationThere are several program synthesis studies that have tackled sorting algorithms. For example, White et al.26 use RL for learning sorting functions. Their work uses several heuristics and a domain specific language to yield a sorting algorithm called reinforcement programming sort. Srivastava et al.27 encodes the program synthesis as a verification problem. Specifically, they represent a synthesis task as a tuple consisting of the functional expression, the domains and guards appearing in the synthesized program and the resource constraints. The idea is that, given a prespecified resource constraint, their synthesizer produces a program that meets the predefined specification to ensure correctness. They apply this to discover merge sort and quick sort. Jason Ansel et al.28 takes as input predefined algorithms (for example, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort) and then determines when to select these algorithms for execution using its autotuner function. It does so by defining a language that contains rules and transforms that dictate how the algorithms are selected and where they are executed. Data availability The data used to train the system were generated synthetically according to the procedures explained in the paper. The algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for the copy and swap operators are presented in the main paper. We have also released the discovered AlphaDev assembly implementations for sort 3–8 as well as VarSort3, 4 and 5 on Github at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev. We have included exhaustive tests to ensure that each implementation is correct. In addition, Appendix G in Supplementary Information contains a list of additional, correct sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The performance of the sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms on the official LLVM benchmarking suite for three different CPU architectures as well as floats, int32 and int64 data types is detailed in Appendix E in the Supplementary Information. In addition, the AlphaDev sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 implementations can be found in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library3. Code availability We have also released pseudocode at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev that includes the environment, the full actor and training loops as well as the core MCTS algorithm. In addition, we include our actual JAX implementation of our policy, value and representation networks that enable the architectures to be reproduced. Finally, we have a config file containing the hyperparameter definitions to be used with the agent. ReferencesAmazon. Amazon S3—two trillion objects, 1.1 million requests/second.

It also contains a CPU State Encoder network that receives as input the current state of memory and registers. The exact architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the Supplementary Information, Appendix A. (b) Before inputting instructions into the Transformer Encoder network, each program instruction’s opcode and operands are converted to one-hot encodings and concatenated. The resulting encoding is then fed into the Transformer Encoder network.Extended Data Fig. 2 An example sorting network43.(a) The horizontal lines are called wires and the vertical lines are called comparators. (b) An initially unsorted sequence of values are input into the sorting network on the left hand side. At various stages two wires encounter a comparator. If the value at the top of the comparator is smaller than the value at the bottom of the comparator, the numbers switch wires. An optimal sorting network places comparators in specific positions so as to sort any sequence of unsorted values using the minimum number of comparators.Extended Data Fig. 3 Hypothesis for improved exploration using AlphaDev.(a) A 2D t-SNE51 projection indicating the regions explored by AlphaDev (blue) compared to AlphaDev-S.

As demand for computation grows, it has become critical for these algorithms to be as performant as possible. Whereas remarkable progress has been achieved in the past2, making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library3. This change to this part of the sort library represents the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We also present results in extra domains, showcasing the generality of the approach.MainHuman intuition and know-how have been crucial in improving algorithms. However, many algorithms have reached a stage whereby human experts have not been able to optimize them further, leading to an ever-growing computational bottleneck. The work in classical program synthesis literature, spanning many decades, aims to generate correct programs and/or optimize programs using proxies for latency. These include enumerative search techniques4,5,6,7 and stochastic search5,6,8,9,10 as well as the more recent trend of using deep learning in program synthesis for generating correct programs11,12,13,14,15,16. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we can take this a step further by generating correct and performant algorithms by optimizing for actual measured latency at the CPU instruction level, by more efficiently searching and considering the space of correct and fast programs compared to previous work.One of the fundamental questions in computer science is how to sort a sequence17,18,19,20. This is taught in elementary computer science classes around the world21,22 and is used ubiquitously by a vast range of applications23,24,25. Decades of computer science research have focused on discovering and optimizing sorting algorithms26,27,28. A key component of practical solutions is a small sort over a short sequence of elements; this algorithm is called repeatedly when sorting large arrays that use divide-and-conquer approaches29. In this work, we focus on two types of small sort algorithm: (1) the fixed sort and (2) the variable sort. Fixed sort algorithms sort sequences of a fixed length (for example, sort 3 can only sort sequences of length 3), whereas variable sort algorithms can sort a sequence of varying size (for example, variable sort 5 can sort sequences ranging from one to five elements).We formulate the problem of discovering new, efficient sorting algorithms as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. In this game, the player selects a series of low-level CPU instructions, which we refer to as assembly instructions30, to combine to yield a new and efficient sorting algorithm. This is challenging as the player needs to consider the combinatorial space of assembly instructions to yield an algorithm that is both provably correct and fast. The hardness of the AssemblyGame arises not only from the size of the search space, which is similar to extremely challenging games such as chess (10120 games)31 and Go (10700 games)32, but also from the nature of the reward function. A single incorrect instruction in the AssemblyGame can potentially invalidate the entire algorithm, making exploration in this space of games incredibly challenging.To play the game, we introduce AlphaDev, a learning agent that is trained to search for correct and efficient algorithms. This agent is comprised of two core components, namely (1) a learning algorithm and (2) a representation function. The AlphaDev learning algorithm can incorporate both DRL as well as stochastic search optimization algorithms to play AssemblyGame. The primary learning algorithm in AlphaDev is an extension of AlphaZero33, a well-known DRL algorithm, in which a neural network is trained to guide a search to solve AssemblyGame. The representation function is interchangeable and captures the underlying structure of assembly programs. The primary AlphaDev representation is based on Transformers34.Using AlphaDev, we have discovered fixed and variable sort algorithms from scratch that are both new and more efficient than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks. The fixed sort solutions for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 discovered by AlphaDev have been integrated into the standard sort function in the LLVM standard C++ library3. This library is used by several million users including universities and numerous international companies35. In addition, we analyse the new algorithm discoveries, compare AlphaDev to stochastic search optimization approaches and apply AlphaDev to further domains to showcase the generality of the approach.Representing algorithms as low-level CPU instructionsWhen compiling algorithms to machine code from a high level language such as C++ (for example, the sorting function in Fig. 1a), the algorithm is first compiled into assembly (Fig. 1b). The assembler then converts the assembly program into executable machine code. In this work, we optimize algorithms at the assembly level30. In a typical assembly program, the values are copied from memory into registers, manipulated between registers and then written back to memory. The set of assembly instructions supported depends on the processor architecture. For the purposes of this work, we focus on a subset of assembly instructions supported by the x86 processor architecture using the AT&T syntax36. Each instruction is of the format Opcode⟨OperandA, OperandB⟩. An example instruction is mov, which is defined as move a value from source (A) to destination (B). Further instruction definitions such as compare (cmp), conditional move (cmovX) and jump (jX) can be found in Extended Data Table 1. In the example in Fig. 1b, %eax, %ecx, %edx, %edi correspond to four different register locations and (%rsi), 4(%rsi) correspond to two different memory locations. The symbol $2 is a placeholder for a constant value, which corresponds to the length of the vector in this example. We use the terms assembly program and assembly algorithm interchangeably in this work. This is because AlphaDev builds an assembly program from scratch, from an initially unordered set of instructions, each time it plays AssemblyGame, defining a new and efficient algorithm.a, A C++ implementation of a variable sort 2 function that sorts any input sequence of up to two elements. b, The C++ implementation in a is compiled to this equivalent low-level assembly representation.DRL for discovering faster algorithmsIn this section, we formulate optimizing algorithms at the CPU instruction level as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem37, in which the environment is modelled as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. Each state in this game is defined as a vector St = ⟨Pt, Zt⟩ where Pt is a representation of the algorithm generated thus far in the game and Zt represents the state of memory and registers after executing the current algorithm on a set of predefined inputs. As seen in Fig. 2a, at timestep t, the player receives the current state St and executes an action at. This involves appending a legal assembly instruction (for example, mov<A,B>) to the current algorithm generated thus far. A reward rtis received that comprises both a measure of algorithm correctness and latency. Algorithm correctness (Fig. 2b) involves inputting a set of N test sequences into the current algorithm Pt to generate N outputs. These outputs are then compared to the expected outputs and a correctness reward rt is computed. Latency rewards can be generated by either (1) penalizing the agent for increasing the length of the algorithm (when length and latency are highly correlated) that we refer to as the algorithm length reward, or (2) measuring the actual latency of the algorithm. The game is executed for a limited number of steps, after which the game is terminated. Winning the game corresponds to generating a correct, low-latency algorithm using assembly instructions. Losing the game corresponds to generating an incorrect algorithm or a correct but inefficient algorithm.a, The AssemblyGame is played by AlphaDev, which receives as input the current assembly algorithm generated thus far St and plays the game by selecting an action to execute. In this example, the action is a mov<Register0,Memory1> assembly instruction, which is appended to the current algorithm. The agent receives a reward that is a function of the algorithm’s correctness, discussed in b, as well as the algorithm’s latency. The game is won by the player discovering a low latency, correct algorithm. b, The program correctness and latency computations are used to compute the reward rt. In this example, test sequences are input to the algorithm; for example, in the case of sorting three elements, test inputs comprise all sequences of unsorted elements of length 3. For each sequence, the algorithm output is compared to the expected output (in the case of sorting, the expected output is the sorted elements). In this example, the output \\({\\bf{D}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) does not match the expected output \\({\\bf{B}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) and the algorithm is therefore incorrect.We refer to the agent that plays this single-player game as AlphaDev. The agent’s primary learning algorithm is an extension of the AlphaZero agent32 and guides a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) planning procedure using a deep neural network33,38. The input to the neural network is the state St and the output is a policy and value prediction. The policy prediction is a distribution over actions and the value function is a prediction of the cumulative returns R that the agent should expect to receive from the current state St. During a game, the agent receives as input the current state St. The agent then executes an MCTS procedure and uses this to select the next action to take. The generated games are then used to update the network’s parameters, enabling the agent to learn.It is critical that AlphaDev has a representation39,40 capable of representing complex algorithmic structures to efficiently explore the space of instructions. To achieve this, we introduce the AlphaDev representation network (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This network comprises two components, namely (1) a transformer encoder network that provides the agent with a representation of the algorithm structure, and (2) the CPU state encoder network that helps the agent predict how the algorithm affects the dynamics of memory and registers. The CPU state encoder network comprises a multilayer perceptron that receives as input the state of each register and memory location for a given set of inputs. These networks each output embeddings that are combined to yield the AlphaDev state representation.Transformer encoderTransformers are natural text encoders and have had much success with language models recently14,34,41. As such, this motivated us to adapt the standard transformer to model assembly instructions. We developed and incorporated a transformer encoder, our adaptation of the MultiQuery transformer encoder42, into the AlphaDev representation network to represent the assembly instructions. Each assembly instruction’s Opcode and corresponding Operands are converted to one-hot encodings and concatenated to form the raw input sequence. This is fed through a multilayer transformer encoder, which maps it to corresponding embedding vectors (see Extended Data Fig. 1b for an illustration).Latency value functionsLatency is an important reward signal that is used to guide the agent in discovering performant algorithms. To better estimate latency, we implemented a dual value function setup, whereby AlphaDev has two value function heads: one predicting algorithm correctness and the second predicting algorithm latency. The latency head is used to directly predict the latency of a given program by using the program’s actual computed latency as a Monte Carlo target for AlphaDev during training. This dual-head approach achieved substantially better results than the vanilla, single head value function setup when optimizing for real latency.ResultsDiscovering faster sort algorithmsWe trained the AlphaDev agent from scratch to generate a range of fixed sort and variable sort algorithms that are both correct and achieve lower latency than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks.Fixed sorting algorithmsWe considered three fundamental algorithms: sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The state-of-the-art human benchmarks for these algorithms are sorting networks43 as they generate efficient, conditional branchless assembly code. This means that all instructions are executed sequentially and there is no branching involved. Improving on these algorithms is challenging as they are already highly optimized. As seen in Table 1a, AlphaDev is able to find algorithms with fewer instructions than the human benchmarks for sort 3 and sort 5 and matches the state-of-the-art performance on sort 4. These shorter algorithms do indeed lead to lower latency as the algorithm length and latency are correlated for the conditional branchless case; see Appendix B in Supplementary Information for more details. We also explored scaling to slightly larger sorts using a variant of AlphaDev. We managed to save three instructions on sort 6, two instructions on sort 7 and one instruction on sort 8, which provides a promising basis for future work. See Appendix C in Supplementary Information for an overview of the approach.Variable sorting algorithmsWe considered three variable sorting algorithms: VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5. The human benchmark in each case is defined as an algorithm that, for a given input length, calls the corresponding sorting network. In this case, branching is required, which greatly increases the complexity of the problem as the agent needs to (1) determine how many subalgorithms it needs to construct and (2) build the body of the main algorithm in parallel. The agent may also need to call subalgorithms from other subalgorithms. In this case, optimizing for length leads to significantly shorter algorithms compared to the human benchmarks as seen in Table 1a. However, owing to the complexities introduced by branching, latency and length are not always correlated; see Supplementary Information for more details. As such, we implemented a procedure that measures the actual latency of the programs by taking the fifth percentile of latency measurements across 100 different machines, with computed confidence intervals44, and optimize this metric. See Methods for the full benchmarking setup. When optimizing for latency, the agent improves significantly on the human benchmarks in each case as seen in Table 1b.New algorithm discoveriesThe solutions discovered by AlphaDev include new and exciting algorithmic discoveries that lead to more efficient performance. In the fixed sort setting, we found that AlphaDev discovered two interesting sequences of instructions that, when applied to a sorting network algorithm, reduce the algorithm by one assembly instruction each time. We refer to each sequence of instructions as (1) the AlphaDev swap move and (2) the AlphaDev copy move respectively.AlphaDev swap moveFigure 3a presents an optimal sorting network for three elements (see Methods for an overview of sorting networks). We will explain how AlphaDev has improved the circled network segment. There are many variants of this structure that are found in sorting networks of various sizes, and the same argument applies in each case. The circled part of the network (last two comparators) can be seen as a sequence of instructions that takes an input sequence ⟨A, B, C⟩ and transforms each input as shown in Table 2a (left). However, a comparator on wires B and C precedes this operator and therefore input sequences where B ≤ C are guaranteed. This means that it is enough to compute min(A, B) as the first output instead of min(A, B, C) as shown in Table 2a (right). The pseudocode difference between Fig. 3b,c demonstrates how the AlphaDev swap move saves one instruction each time it is applied.a, An optimal classic sorting network for three inputs. The circled comparators have been improved by AlphaDev. See the AlphaDev swap move for more details. b,c, The assembly pseudocode before applying the AlphaDev swap move (b) and after applying the AlphaDev swap move (c), resulting in the removal of a single instruction. d, An optimal classic sorting network comparator configuration that has been improved by AlphaDev. See the AlphaDev copy move for more details. e,f, The assembly pseudocode before applying the AlphaDev copy move (e) and after applying the AlphaDev copy move (f), resulting in the removal of a single instruction.AlphaDev copy moveFigure 3d presents a sorting network configuration, consisting of three comparators, that is applied across four wires. This configuration is found in a sort 8 sorting network and corresponds to an operator taking four inputs ⟨A, B, C, D⟩ and transforming them into four outputs as seen in Table 2b (on the left). One can show that as part of sort 8, the input that flows into the operator satisfies the following inequality: \\({\\rm{D}}\\ge \\min ({\\rm{A}},{\\rm{C}})\\). This means that the operator can be improved by applying the AlphaDev copy move that is defined in Table 2b (on the right), resulting in one instruction less than the original operator. The code difference between the original operator and the code after applying the AlphaDev copy move is visualized in Fig. 3e,f, respectively.New variable sort algorithmsThe VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev is particularly interesting. The flow diagram for the human benchmark algorithm and AlphaDev can be seen in Fig. 4a,b, respectively. The human benchmark algorithm determines the length of the input vector, and then calls the corresponding sorting network to sort the elements. The AlphaDev solution has a completely different approach as seen in Fig. 4b. If the length of the input vector is strictly greater than 2, then sort 3 is immediately called, resulting in the first three elements being sorted. If the vector is greater than three elements, then a simplified sort 4 algorithm is called that sorts the remaining unsorted elements in the input vector. It is this simplified part of the routine that yields significant gains in terms of algorithmic length and latency.a, A flow diagram of the variable sort 4 (VarSort4) human benchmark algorithm. In this algorithm, a sequence of unsorted numbers are input into the algorithm. If the sequence length is four, three or two numbers, then the corresponding sort 4, sort 3 or sort 2 sorting network is called that sorts the resulting sequence. The result is then returned and output by the function. b, The VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev. This algorithm also receives sequences of length four, three or two numbers as input. In this case, if the length is two, then it calls the sort 2 sorting network and returns. If the length is three then it calls sort 3 to sort the first three numbers and returns. If, however, the length is greater than three, then it calls sort 3, followed by a simplified sort 4 routine that sorts the remaining unsorted number. It is this part of the routine that results in significant latency savings.Stochastic search optimization approachesIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8, adapted it to the sort setting and used it as the learning algorithm in AlphaDev. We refer to this variant as AlphaDev-S (see Methods for more details). We run this algorithm with at least the same amount of resources and wall-clock time as AlphaDev. AlphaDev-S requires a prohibitive amount of time to optimize directly for latency as latency needs to be computed after every mutation. As such, AlphaDev-S optimizes for a latency proxy, namely algorithm length and, then, at the end of training, we search through all correct programs generated by AlphaDev-S and benchmark each one to find the lowest latency solution. In general, we find that AlphaDev consistently outperforms AlphaDev-S when learning from scratch without previous knowledge. In addition, as the size of the program increases, AlphaDev explores orders of magnitude fewer programs (12 million programs in the worst case) compared to AlphaDev-S (31 trillion programs in the worst case). This may be because AlphaDev is able to better explore the space of algorithms compared to the breadth-first stochastic search procedure that gets stuck more easily into local optima; see Methods for an overview of this exploration hypothesis. In addition, AlphaDev never evaluates latency during search as it uses the latency value function predictions and, because of this, only needs to compute actual measured latency on less than 0.002% of generated programs. When incorporating previous knowledge into AlphaDev-S, such as warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal solution, AlphaDev-S is more computationally efficient for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 (branchless assembly algorithms) and also generates competitive low-latency algorithms to that of AlphaDev in each case. However, for algorithms that require branching (if–else statements), in which algorithm length and latency are not well correlated, AlphaDev discovers lower latency solutions than AlphaDev-S, even when warm starting this algorithm with a near-optimal solution. See Methods for an in-depth analysis of these algorithms.Generalization to additional domainsTo test the generality of AlphaDev, we train the agent on a set of additional domains. These include a protocol buffer deserialization subroutine called VarInt, presented below, and a competitive coding problem (see Appendix D in Supplementary Information for more details). The competitive coding domain latency performance is reported in Table 1b.Protocol Buffer is Google’s open-source data format used to serialize structured data45. This format is commonly used in cases in which performance or network load is of primary concern. The VarInt algorithm46 is a key component in both the serialization and deserialization processes. We trained the AlphaDev agent as in variable sort to optimize the VarInt deserialization function with respect to correctness and measured latency. For correctness, we reward the agent for correctly deserializing each input. We use a set of 80 inputs and corresponding outputs that cover common protobuf use cases. AlphaDev learns an optimized VarInt deserialization function and manages to significantly outperform the human benchmark for single valued inputs. Our agent discovers a branchless solution that is both shorter (Table 1a) and roughly three times faster than the human benchmark (Table 1b). In doing so, the agent also discovered a new VarInt assignment move in which AlphaDev learns to combine two operations into a single instruction leading to latency savings. See Appendix D.1 in Supplementary Information for a full overview of this move. This is a strong indication that AlphaDev is capable of generalizing to optimize non-trivial, real-world algorithms.Libc++ sort patchThe sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library are called many times by larger sorting algorithms and are therefore fundamental components of the library. We reverse engineered the low-level assembly sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 to C++ and discovered that our sort implementations led to improvements of up to 70% for sequences of a length of five and roughly 1.7% for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements. These improvements are for the uint32, uint64 and float data types for ARMv8, Intel Skylake and AMD Zen 2 CPU architectures; see Appendix E in Supplementary Information for the full performance tables. The performance improvements are due to both the branchless conditional assembly generated by AlphaDev as well as the new AlphaDev swap move. For sort 5, we used a 43 length algorithm discovered by AlphaDev, as it led to a more efficient C++ implementation. These algorithms were sent for review and have officially been included in the libc++ standard sorting library3. It is the first change to these sub-routines in over a decade. This is also the first time that any component in this sort library has been replaced by an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We estimate that these routines are being called trillions of times every day1,35,47.DiscussionAlphaDev discovers new, state-of-the-art sorting algorithms from scratch that have been incorporated into the LLVM C++ library, used by millions of developers and applications around the world23,24,25. Both AlphaDev and stochastic search are powerful algorithms. An interesting direction for future research is to investigate combining these algorithms together to realize the complementary advantages of both approaches.It is important to note that AlphaDev can, in theory, generalize to functions that do not require exhaustive verification of test cases. For example, hashing functions48 as well as cryptographic hashing functions49 define function correctness by the number of hashing collisions. Therefore, in this case, AlphaDev can optimize for minimizing collisions as well as latency. AlphaDev can also, in theory, optimize complicated logic components within the body of large, impressive functions. We hope that AlphaDev can provide interesting insights and inspire new approaches in both the artificial intelligence and program synthesis communities.MethodsBackgroundAlphaZeroAlphaZero33 is an RL algorithm that leverages MCTS as a policy improvement operator. It consists of (1) a representation network frep that outputs a latent representation ht of the state St; and (2) a prediction network fpred that predicts the expected return (the value) \\({\\hat{v}}_{t}\\) and a policy (that is, distribution over the action space) \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) from a given latent state. The algorithm uses the true dynamics and reward when planning. MuZero38 is a model-based variant of AlphaZero that has the same representation and prediction networks, but also learns a model of the dynamics and predicts rewards, which it uses for planning. Specifically, it learns a dynamics network fdyn that predicts the next latent state \\({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) and reward \\({\\hat{r}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) resulting from a transition. Note that the subscript t denotes timesteps in the real environment and the superscript k represents timesteps in the model.On reaching a new state, AlphaZero proceeds by first encoding the state into a latent representation with the representation network. Then, the true dynamics or dynamics network (for MuZero) as well as the prediction network fpred(ht) are used to simulate several trajectories that fill out a search tree, by sampling state transitions. At each node, the actions are selected using an optimistic strategy called the predictor upper confidence tree bound32, meant to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (progressing further down the subtree of the current estimate of the best action). This strategy starts out by following the predicted policy \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) closely, and gradually shifts towards maximizing the predicted value function. Ultimately, an action is recommended by sampling from the root node with probability proportional to its visit count during MCTS. The predicted policy is then trained to match the visit counts of the MCTS policy in an attempt to distil the search procedure into a policy such that subsequent iterations of MCTS will disregard nodes that are not promising.Sorting networksSorting networks are very efficient as their structures can be parallelized on modern CPU architectures. They therefore tend to achieve faster runtime performance, especially on small sorts, compared to popular and efficient base case algorithms such as insertion sort17,43,50. A sorting network43 consists of two types of item called comparators (vertical lines) and wires (horizontal lines) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Each wire carries a value from left to right. When two wires intersect at a comparator, the values on the two wires are compared. If the value of the bottom wire is smaller than the value of the top wire, then the values are swapped between wires as seen in Extended Data Fig. 2b. A programmatic implementation of a sorting network consists of executing these swaps on particular pairs of elements from the input sequence in a particular order.Action pruning rulesWe pruned the action space by removing some program invariances (for example, the order of register allocation) and illegal instructions (for example, comparing two memory locations). This helps reducing the size of the action space and increases convergence rate. For our experiments, we used the following rules:Memory locations are always read in incremental order.Registers are allocated in incremental order.We cannot compare or conditionally move to a memory location (illegal).We can read and write to each memory location only once.We cannot use non-initialized registers (illegal).Do not perform consecutive compare instructions.Training regimeWe train AlphaDev on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v.3, with a total batch size of 1,024 per TPU core. We use up to 16 TPU cores and train for 1 million iterations. On the actor side, the games are played on standalone TPU v.4, and we use up to 512 actors. In practice, across all tasks, training takes, in the worst case, 2 days to converge.AlphaDev-SIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other possible approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8 and incorporated it into AlphaDev as the learning algorithm to optimize sorting functions. We refer to this adapted version as AlphaDev-S. Our re-implementation has been specifically optimized for the sorting domain. This includes implementing the algorithm to run with our assembly environment, defining a correctness and performance loss function specific to sorting and running extensive hyperparameter sweeps to identify the best variant. The cost function used for AlphaDev-S is c = correctness + α × performance where correctness corresponds to computing the number of incorrect input sequence elements that are still unsorted, performance corresponds to the algorithm length reward and α is a weight trading off the two cost functions. We are unable to optimize directly for latency as this slows down the learning algorithm considerably making learning infeasible. It should be noted that this function has been adapted to support the same set of assembly instructions used by AlphaDev as well as prune the same set of incorrect or illegal actions. It also uses the same program correctness computation module (Fig. 2b) to compute the correctness term.AlphaDev-S is then executed by first proposing a transformation to the program stored in the buffer (which may be empty or initialized with an already sorted program). The correctness and performance terms are then computed using the program correctness module and algorithm length, respectively. If the cost is lower than the current best cost, the new program is accepted with high probability, otherwise it is rejected. We will now discuss the correctness cost function and transform weights in more detail.Correctness costFor the correctness cost function, we implemented three types of cost function. The first one is defined as the percentage of incorrectly placed items: \\(\\frac{P-P{C}_{t}}{P}\\) where P is the total number of items to place and PCt is number of correctly placed items at timestep t. The second variant is the square root of this equation. The final cost function takes the square root of the difference \\(\\sqrt{-{PC}_{t}}\\) and this is what yielded the best performance.Program transformationsWe enabled several program transformations such as adding an instruction to increase the size of the program (Add Transform), swapping two instructions (Swap Transform), randomly changing an Opcode for an instruction (Opcode Transform), randomly sampling an Operand for a chosen instruction (Operand Transform) and randomly sample an Opcode and its corresponding Operands (Instruction Transform). It is possible to influence the sampling of these transforms to encourage some to be sampled more or less frequently. We optimized the weights for sampling transforms by running an extensive hyperparameter sweep.Investigative studies for AlphaDev variantsWe now present a set of investigative studies that help to better understand the advantages and limitations of the DRL and the stochastic search learning algorithms used in AlphaDev. We compare AlphaDev to AlphaDev-S. We implemented two variants of AlphaDev-S: (1) Cold Start (AlphaDev-S-CS) and (2) Warm Start (AlphaDev-S-WS). AlphaDev-S-CS uses no previous information and has to generate a program from an empty program buffer. AlphaDev-S-WS’s buffer is warm started with a correct sorting program (for example, optimal sorting network assembly program) and it edits the program to optimize it further. We compared the variants with AlphaDev in both the individual and variable sort algorithm setups.Because AlphaDev always learns from scratch with no previous knowledge, the direct comparison would be to the cold start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-CS. However, as initial near-optimal programs may sometimes be available, we also compare AlphaDev to the warm start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-WS.It should be noted that the stochastic search variants are unable to optimize directly for latency, as this would make learning infeasible because of computational efficiency. As such, our AlphaDev-S variants optimize for algorithm length. Then, at the end of training, we iterate through the set of generated programs for AlphaDev-S across varying lengths and identify the program with the lowest latency.In each case, the stochastic search algorithms (AlphaDev-S) are run using at least the same computational resources and wall-clock time to that of AlphaDev.Fixed sortWe first examine the performance of the various approaches for the fixed sort algorithms. In this case, all algorithmic variants optimize for algorithm length as algorithm length and latency are highly correlated in the conditional branchless setting (see Supplementary Information for more details).In the cold start setting, AlphaDev-S-CS is unable to find the optimal programs in each case as seen in Extended Data Table 2a. In addition, AlphaDev-S-CS explores orders of magnitude more programs than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. In the warm start setting, AlphaDev-S is warm started with a near-optimal sorted program, and is able to match the performance of AlphaDev in each case as shown in Extended Data Table 2a. It is more computationally efficient than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2c but explores orders of magnitude more programs for sort 3 and sort 5 as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. It can be argued that AlphaDev-S-WS has a substantial advantage in this scenario as it is provided with an initial near-optimal program. We will show in the Variable sort section that when the algorithms become more complicated and branching is introduced, warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal program is not enough and can cause it to get stuck in suboptimal solutions.Brute-force approachWe also used a brute-force approach to prove that no program shorter than 17 instructions exists for sort 3. We had to enumerate roughly 1032 programs and, even with pruning heuristics, it took more than 3 days to prove this hypothesis. For sort 4 and above this approach is infeasible.Latency benchmarking suiteThe length of a program is only a proxy for the performance of an algorithm. As we introduce branching structures, the length and latency of a program are not well correlated. Therefore, we run the programs on actual machines and measure their latency. Microbenchmarking is very challenging given the numerous noise sources that could affect the measurements. This is especially true when running on shared machines where there could be interference from other processes. Our approach is to have a separate benchmarking service, replicated on separated machines, so that we can quickly perform many measurements in a controlled environment under different conditions. The system works as follows:The RL agent processes 1,000 measurements across the machines using the replicated service.For each measurement, the service runs the given sorting algorithm over 10,000 random inputs (for example, for sort 3 this would be 3 × 10,000 = 30,000 random integers).We measure the time taken using a CPU performance counter (CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.CORE).We then take the fifth percentile as our final measurement, because we assume that most noise sources are one-sided (for example, cache misses, pre-emptions and so on). During training we process the measurements across ten machines for computational efficiency. After training, we benchmark AlphaDev’s solution against the baseline solutions, and process the measurements across 100 machines for more accuracy and noise reduction. For each benchmark, we compute confidence intervals using the distribution-free two-sided confidence interval for a quantile tabular method44.Variable sortWhen optimizing directly for latency, AlphaDev outperforms AlphaDev-S-WS on VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5 as seen in Extended Data Table 3a. AlphaDev-S-CS fails to find a solution in each case. In the cases of VarSort4 and VarSort5, program length and latency are not correlated (see Supplementary Information for more details). This indicates that when program length cannot be used as a proxy for performance, AlphaDev is able to find lower latency solutions compared to AlphaDev-S. This is even in the case where the stochastic search is warm started with a near-optimal program. In addition, AlphaDev converges to the optimal solution after exploring a maximum of 12M programs as seen in Extended Data Table 3b. This is orders of magnitude lower than that of AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively (31 trillion programs in the worst case).Exploration hypothesisWe proposed that AlphaDev-S struggles to discover programs when learning from scratch and gets stuck in local optima when warm started because of its limited exploration capabilities as a result of the stochastic search procedure. Extended Data Fig. 3 shows two-dimensional t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) projections51 of AlphaDev and AlphaDev-S’s assembly algorithms discovered during their respective training procedures for VarSort5. The features used in the projection include correctness, latency, algorithm length and a histogram count of the instructions used per algorithm. Extended Data Fig. 3a indicates the regions in algorithm space explored by AlphaDev, AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively, whereas Extended Data Fig. 3b superimposes algorithm correctness onto each point in the t-SNE projection in which the colour indicates the correctness of each discovered algorithm, ranging from incorrect algorithms (purple) to correct algorithms (yellow). The AlphaDev-S variants both cover a densely packed circular region around their initial seed, which highlights the breadth-first nature of their stochastic search procedure. This illustrates that AlphaDev-S-CS fails to navigate through the space of incorrect algorithms in a reasonable amount of time and discover correct algorithms when learning from scratch. A similar argument applies to AlphaDev-S-WS whereby, when optimizing from an already correct but suboptimal expert demonstration, the algorithm is biased towards exploring its vicinity and struggles to escape this local maxima. By contrast, AlphaDev has more diverse algorithm space coverage, as the long-term value function is a guiding signal for discovering new and interesting parts of algorithm space. As seen in Extended Data Fig. 3b, it is capable of escaping the space of incorrect algorithms to discover a new space of correct algorithms, highlighting the exploration advantages afforded by AlphaDev.Related workAssembly optimizationThere are numerous approaches to optimizing assembly programs, which we have classified into three groups: enumerative search, stochastic search and symbolic search5.First, enumerative search techniques include brute-force program enumeration4,5,6 as well as implicit enumeration using symbolic theorem proving52,53. These approaches search through the space of programs to find a solution based on a predefined set of programs, heuristic and/or cost function. These approaches struggle to span large regions of program space, especially as the size and complexity of the program increases.Second, stochastic search techniques circumvent comprehensive enumeration by relying on sampling mechanisms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling5,6,8,9. Rajeev Alur et al.5 define a correctness specification, provided by a logical formula that uses symbols from a background theory. The goal is to then find an implementation expression such that logical formula defining the specification is valid. The idea is to iteratively add test cases and then search and expand the program to solve the given test cases. They optimize for correctness on problems from the book Hacker’s delight54. Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana et al.6 introduce the LENS algorithm that is based on running enumerative, stochastic and symbolic search in parallel, while relying on handcrafted pruning rules. This setup is capable of optimizing up to 21 instructions, and cannot optimize for latency nor support branching. Another algorithm8 is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo rejection sampling and applies transformations to programs in assembly using a loss function that is a function of correctness and performance. Many of these approaches are prone to getting stuck in local minima and may also struggle as the size and/or complexity of the program increases. In addition, incorporating actual, measured latency into these approaches are either infeasible or prohibitively expensive.Third, symbolic search approaches can also be implemented to optimize assembly programs. These include SAT solvers55, SMT solvers5,6 and Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs)56,57. However, these approaches suffer from scaling issues. For example, classical solvers require a problem to be translated into a certain canonical form. It usually requires an expert in the said solvers and a substantial amount of time to find an efficient formulation. In addition, for any new modification of the problem, this has to be repeated. Classical solvers are also hard to parallelize and thus, it is challenging to leverage more hardware to speed up the solving process. Another symbolic search algorithm is Cholorphyll10 that implements a multi-phase approach. It first requires as input a source program with partition annotations that specify where code and data reside. Then, a layout synthesizer maps program fragments onto physical cores to minimize computational costs. The code is then separated into per-core program fragments and the program fragments are compiled into machine code. At this point, a superoptimizer optimizes each of these fragments.SIMD optimizationVarious approaches58,59,60 have also been applied to sorting functions that run in the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)61 setup. This setup is capable of parallelizing instruction execution, but is not supported at present in popular libraries such as LLVM’s libc++ std::sort library. One example is that from Gilles Barthe et al.7 that proposes a methodology for optimizing programs by automatically vectorizing loops with SIMD instructions. They do this by introducing a framework for verifying the correctness of transformations to a program and performing a search-based procedure using the said transformation. Their framework can discover SIMD looping structures of up to nine instructions in 0.12 s, which corresponds to a minimum 2× speed-up.RL approaches for program synthesisThere are also several studies using RL for program optimization. Kevin Ellis et al.62 learn a policy and value function to write and evaluate code, as well as performing a Monte Carlo-style search strategy during inference. This work requires a pretraining step and aims to generate correct programs that satisfy a predefined specification. The approach is successfully applied to computer-aided design and string editing programs. SuperSonic63 uses an RL meta-optimizer to select between different RL architectures, using a Multi-Armed Bandit policy search to find a state representation, reward function and RL algorithm that is optimal for the current task. This requires keeping track of many RL algorithms and architectures, which are used as part of the state space. By contrast, our approach only focuses on training a single RL architecture, taking advantage of MCTS search and powerful state representations. Shypula et al.64 create a supervised assembly dataset and use it to train a Transformer model for mapping unoptimized to optimized code, followed by an RL stage for improving the solution quality. Our method does not require a supervised dataset or two separate training and finetuning stages, and optimizes everything end-to-end using RL and search instead. Chen et al.65 define their own domain specific language and perform input–output program synthesis that better uses the intermediate program representation to guide the synthesis routine. They show that this can be incorporated with RL, using the setup of Rudy Bunel et al.66 and improve the correctness of generated functions. They do not, however, optimize for program length or latency.Input–output examples for program synthesisA large body of work addresses the problem of learning programs from input–output pairs. One type of approach learns a neural network for matching inputs to outputs directly11,13,67,68. This approach is difficult to integrate into existing libraries and can struggle to generalize to previously unseen inputs, although there has been some encouraging recent progress using graph representations69. Another type of approach is to perform a search in program space, guided by a learned model12,70,71,72. For instance, Chen et al.70 use a model that predicts the next program token on the basis of a partial program and the input–output pairs. This bears some similarities to how search is guided in our approach: the learned policy prior in AlphaZero is a model for predicting the next token, learned on the basis of a combination of a partial program and that program’s effects on the inputs. However, we are interested in finding correct and efficient programs, which we achieve by further learning a value function for approximating the expected latency of partial programs, and using AlphaZero to incorporate this value function into the search process.Deep learning for code generationThere are also several deep learning approaches that use large languages models to generate code. These approaches vary in their uses from transpilation, code refactoring and explaining code15 to generating human-level competitive code using a natural language description14. That particular work aims to generate correct code, but does not focus on generating low-latency solutions.Sort-based program optimizationThere are several program synthesis studies that have tackled sorting algorithms. For example, White et al.26 use RL for learning sorting functions. Their work uses several heuristics and a domain specific language to yield a sorting algorithm called reinforcement programming sort. Srivastava et al.27 encodes the program synthesis as a verification problem. Specifically, they represent a synthesis task as a tuple consisting of the functional expression, the domains and guards appearing in the synthesized program and the resource constraints. The idea is that, given a prespecified resource constraint, their synthesizer produces a program that meets the predefined specification to ensure correctness. They apply this to discover merge sort and quick sort. Jason Ansel et al.28 takes as input predefined algorithms (for example, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort) and then determines when to select these algorithms for execution using its autotuner function. It does so by defining a language that contains rules and transforms that dictate how the algorithms are selected and where they are executed.Data availabilityThe data used to train the system were generated synthetically according to the procedures explained in the paper. The algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for the copy and swap operators are presented in the main paper. We have also released the discovered AlphaDev assembly implementations for sort 3–8 as well as VarSort3, 4 and 5 on Github at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev. We have included exhaustive tests to ensure that each implementation is correct. In addition, Appendix G in Supplementary Information contains a list of additional, correct sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The performance of the sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms on the official LLVM benchmarking suite for three different CPU architectures as well as floats, int32 and int64 data types is detailed in Appendix E in the Supplementary Information. In addition, the AlphaDev sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 implementations can be found in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library3.Code availabilityWe have also released pseudocode at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev that includes the environment, the full actor and training loops as well as the core MCTS algorithm. In addition, we include our actual JAX implementation of our policy, value and representation networks that enable the architectures to be reproduced. Finally, we have a config file containing the hyperparameter definitions to be used with the agent.ReferencesAmazon. Amazon S3—two trillion objects, 1.1 million requests/second.

It also contains a CPU State Encoder network that receives as input the current state of memory and registers. The exact architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the Supplementary Information, Appendix A. (b) Before inputting instructions into the Transformer Encoder network, each program instruction’s opcode and operands are converted to one-hot encodings and concatenated. The resulting encoding is then fed into the Transformer Encoder network.Extended Data Fig. 2 An example sorting network43.(a) The horizontal lines are called wires and the vertical lines are called comparators. (b) An initially unsorted sequence of values are input into the sorting network on the left hand side. At various stages two wires encounter a comparator. If the value at the top of the comparator is smaller than the value at the bottom of the comparator, the numbers switch wires. An optimal sorting network places comparators in specific positions so as to sort any sequence of unsorted values using the minimum number of comparators.Extended Data Fig. 3 Hypothesis for improved exploration using AlphaDev.(a) A 2D t-SNE51 projection indicating the regions explored by AlphaDev (blue) compared to AlphaDev-S. (b) The same 2D t-SNE projection as in (a) with algorithm correctness superimposed onto each point from incorrect programs (purple) to correct programs (yellow). As seen in the figure, AlphaDev-S struggles to move out of local optima whereas AlphaDev is able to explore from the space of incorrect programs to the space of correct programs.Supplementary informationSupplementary InformationRights and permissionsOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

The algorithm is said to be faster than the current state-of-the-art sorting algorithms, such as quicksort and mergesort.\\n\\nThe team of researchers at Google used deep reinforcement learning to train a neural network to learn how to sort data. The neural network was trained using a reward-based system, where it was rewarded for correctly sorting data and penalized for incorrect sorting.\\n\\nThe result was a sorting algorithm that was faster and more efficient than the current state-of-the-art algorithms. The algorithm was tested on a variety of datasets, including random data and real-world data, and was found to be consistently faster than the other algorithms.\\n\\nThis discovery has the potential to revolutionize the way we sort data, especially in fields where large amounts of data need to be sorted quickly, such as in finance and healthcare.\\n\\nFor developers interested in implementing this algorithm, Google has made the code available on their GitHub repository. Here is an example implementation in Python:\\n\\n```\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef sort_data(data):\\n    # Initialize the neural network\\n    model = initialize_model()\\n\\n    # Sort the data using the neural network\\n    sorted_data = model.predict(data)\\n\\n    return sorted_data\\n\\ndef initialize_model():\\n    # Define the neural network architecture\\n    model = ...\\n\\n    # Train the neural network using deep reinforcement learning\\n    ...\\n\\n    return model\\n```\\n\\nIt is important to note that this algorithm is still in the research phase and may not be suitable for all use cases. However, it is a promising development in the field of sorting algorithms and demonstrates the potential of deep reinforcement learning in solving complex problems.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Google's discovery of a faster sorting algorithm using deep reinforcement learning is a significant development in the field of computer science. Developers should keep an eye on this technology as it has the potential to revolutionize the way we sort data."}

Increase your visibility. Grow your career.Learn more Microsoft released Dev Drive at the Build 2023 developer conference, a custom storage volume geared for developers. Built on top of Microsoft's proprietary ReFS (Resilient File System), Dev Drive is optimized for heavy I/O operations and has improved performance and security capabilities.\nDev Drive includes file-system optimizations and Microsoft claims up to 30% improvement in build times as well as improved security using the new performance mode in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus. In Microsoft Defender performance mode, real-time protection runs asynchronously, balancing security and performance. The balance is reached by delaying security scans until after the file operation has been completed instead of running security scans synchronously while the file operation is being executed. This performance mode is more secure than a folder or process exclusion that disables security scans altogether.\nDev Drive also speeds up other disc-bound operations such as cloning Git repositories, restoring packages, and copying files. Dev Drive is designed for storing source code, package caches and build artifacts but it is not intended for developer tools or installing apps.\nAnother optimization that Dev Drive implements is copy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning. The article on Engineering@Microsoft describes how it works:\nCopy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning in the Windows API documentation, avoids fully copying a file by creating a metadata reference to the original data on-disk. CoW links are like hardlinks but are safe to write to, as the filesystem lazily copies the original data into the link as needed when opened for append or random-access write. With a CoW link you save disk space and time since the link consists of a small amount of metadata and they write fast.\nDev Drive is currently in public preview and is available to Windows Insiders running the Dev Channel of Windows 11. It requires at least 50GB in free space and a minimum of 8GB of RAM though Microsoft recommends 16GB. Users can create a Dev Drive volume as a new virtual hard disk, or it can use unallocated space.\nThose developers who already tried the Dev Drive report getting faster builds, with one user seeing about 40% off npm build and about 20% speedier .NET build. Another user got 25% speed up even though Dev Drive was running on a three-times slower disk.\nDev Drive should appear in the main Windows release channel later this year.

Built on top of Microsoft's proprietary ReFS (Resilient File System), Dev Drive is optimized for heavy I/O operations and has improved performance and security capabilities.Dev Drive includes file-system optimizations and Microsoft claims up to 30% improvement in build times as well as improved security using the new performance mode in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus. In Microsoft Defender performance mode, real-time protection runs asynchronously, balancing security and performance. The balance is reached by delaying security scans until after the file operation has been completed instead of running security scans synchronously while the file operation is being executed. This performance mode is more secure than a folder or process exclusion that disables security scans altogether.Dev Drive also speeds up other disc-bound operations such as cloning Git repositories, restoring packages, and copying files. Dev Drive is designed for storing source code, package caches and build artifacts but it is not intended for developer tools or installing apps.Another optimization that Dev Drive implements is copy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning. The article on Engineering@Microsoft describes how it works:Copy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning in the Windows API documentation, avoids fully copying a file by creating a metadata reference to the original data on-disk. CoW links are like hardlinks but are safe to write to, as the filesystem lazily copies the original data into the link as needed when opened for append or random-access write. With a CoW link you save disk space and time since the link consists of a small amount of metadata and they write fast.Dev Drive is currently in public preview and is available to Windows Insiders running the Dev Channel of Windows 11. It requires at least 50GB in free space and a minimum of 8GB of RAM though Microsoft recommends 16GB. Users can create a Dev Drive volume as a new virtual hard disk, or it can use unallocated space.Those developers who already tried the Dev Drive report getting faster builds, with one user seeing about 40% off npm build and about 20% speedier .NET build. Another user got 25% speed up even though Dev Drive was running on a three-times slower disk.Dev Drive should appear in the main Windows release channel later this year. It will also be available in Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions for faster CI builds in the cloud. In addition to the original release blog post, Microsoft has published a detailed page that describes how to set up Dev Drive, what limitations it has as well as frequently asked questions.About the AuthorGiorgi Dalakishvili Rate this Article This content is in the .NET topic Related Topics:Related EditorialRelated Sponsored ContentRelated SponsorCode, deploy, and scale Java your way.\nMicrosoft Azure supports your workload with abundant choices, whether you're working on a Java app, app server, or framework.

Microsoft has recently released a new feature called Windows Dev Drive, which is a customized storage volume designed specifically for developers.\\n\\nWindows Dev Drive is a feature that allows developers to create a storage volume that is optimized for their development work. This volume is created using a set of predefined settings that are optimized for performance and reliability. The volume is also isolated from the rest of the system, which means that it is not affected by other processes running on the system.\\n\\nOne of the key benefits of Windows Dev Drive is its improved performance. The volume is optimized for sequential and random I/O operations, which means that it can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This is especially important for developers who work with large datasets or perform complex computations.\\n\\nAnother benefit of Windows Dev Drive is its ease of use. Developers can create a new volume with just a few clicks, and the volume is automatically configured with the optimal settings. This means that developers can focus on their work without having to worry about configuring their storage solution.\\n\\nWindows Dev Drive also supports a variety of file systems, including NTFS, ReFS, and FAT32. This means that developers can choose the file system that best suits their needs.\\n\\nIn addition to its performance and ease of use, Windows Dev Drive also provides enhanced security features. The volume is encrypted by default, which means that data stored on the volume is protected from unauthorized access. Developers can also configure additional security settings, such as access control lists (ACLs), to further restrict access to the volume.\\n\\nTo create a new Windows Dev Drive volume, developers can use the Disk Management tool in Windows. The tool provides a simple interface for creating and managing volumes, and it also allows developers to configure advanced settings, such as disk quotas and compression.\\n\\nOverall, Windows Dev Drive is a valuable tool for developers who need a reliable and efficient storage solution for their work. Its optimized performance, ease of use, and enhanced security features make it a great choice for developers who want to focus on their work without having to worry about their storage solution."}

We are releasing a 7B and 3B model trained on 1T tokens, as well as the preview of a 13B model trained on 600B tokens. We provide PyTorch and JAX weights of pre-trained OpenLLaMA models, as well as evaluation results and comparison against the original LLaMA models. Please see the project homepage of OpenLLaMA for more details. Weights Release, License and Usage\nWe release the weights in two formats: an EasyLM format to be use with our EasyLM framework, and a PyTorch format to be used with the Hugging Face transformers library. Both our training framework EasyLM and the checkpoint weights are licensed permissively under the Apache 2.0 license. Loading the Weights with Hugging Face Transformers\nPreview checkpoints can be directly loaded from Hugging Face Hub. Please note that it is advised to avoid using the Hugging Face fast tokenizer for now, as we’ve observed that the auto-converted fast tokenizer sometimes gives incorrect tokenizations. This can be achieved by directly using the LlamaTokenizer class, or passing in the use_fast=False option for the AutoTokenizer class. See the following example for usage.\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import LlamaTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM\nmodel_path = 'openlm-research/open_llama_3b'\n# model_path = 'openlm-research/open_llama_7b'\ntokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\nmodel = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained( model_path, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map='auto',\n)\nprompt = 'Q: What is the largest animal?\\nA:'\ninput_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids\ngeneration_output = model.generate( input_ids=input_ids, max_new_tokens=32\n)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(generation_output[0]))\nFor more advanced usage, please follow the transformers LLaMA documentation. Evaluating with LM-Eval-Harness\nThe model can be evaluated with lm-eval-harness. However, due to the aforementioned tokenizer issue, we need to avoid using the fast tokenizer to obtain the correct results. This can be achieved by passing in use_fast=False to this part of lm-eval-harness, as shown in the example below:\ntokenizer = self.AUTO_TOKENIZER_CLASS.from_pretrained( pretrained if tokenizer is None else tokenizer, revision=revision + ("/" + subfolder if subfolder is not None else ""), use_fast=False\n) Loading the Weights with EasyLM\nFor using the weights in our EasyLM framework, please refer to the LLaMA documentation of EasyLM. Note that unlike the original LLaMA model, our OpenLLaMA tokenizer and weights are trained completely from scratch so it is no longer needed to obtain the original LLaMA tokenizer and weights. Note that we use BOS (beginning of sentence) token (id=1) during training, so it is best to prepend this token for best performance during few-shot evaluation. Dataset and Training\nWe train our models on the RedPajama dataset released by Together, which is a reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset containing over 1.2 trillion tokens. We follow the exactly same preprocessing steps and training hyperparameters as the original LLaMA paper, including model architecture, context length, training steps, learning rate schedule, and optimizer. The only difference between our setting and the original one is the dataset used: OpenLLaMA employs the RedPajama dataset rather than the one utilized by the original LLaMA.\nWe train the models on cloud TPU-v4s using EasyLM, a JAX based training pipeline we developed for training and fine-tuning large language models. We employ a combination of normal data parallelism and fully sharded data parallelism (also know as ZeRO stage 3) to balance the training throughput and memory usage. Overall we reach a throughput of over 2200 tokens / second / TPU-v4 chip for our 7B model. Evaluation\nWe evaluated OpenLLaMA on a wide range of tasks using lm-evaluation-harness. The LLaMA results are generated by running the original LLaMA model on the same evaluation metrics. We note that our results for the LLaMA model differ slightly from the original LLaMA paper, which we believe is a result of different evaluation protocols. Similar differences have been reported in this issue of lm-evaluation-harness. Additionally, we present the results of GPT-J, a 6B parameter model trained on the Pile dataset by EleutherAI.\nThe original LLaMA model was trained for 1 trillion tokens and GPT-J was trained for 500 billion tokens. We present the results in the table below. OpenLLaMA exhibits comparable performance to the original LLaMA and GPT-J across a majority of tasks, and outperforms them in some tasks.\nTask/Metric\nGPT-J 6B\nLLaMA 7B\nOpenLLaMA 7B\nOpenLLaMA 3B\nOpenLLaMA 13B 600BT\nanli_r1/acc\n0.32\n0.35\n0.33\n0.33\n0.33\nanli_r2/acc\n0.34\n0.34\n0.36\n0.32\n0.35\nanli_r3/acc\n0.35\n0.37\n0.38\n0.35\n0.38\narc_challenge/acc\n0.34\n0.39\n0.37\n0.34\n0.39\narc_challenge/acc_norm\n0.37\n0.41\n0.38\n0.37\n0.42\narc_easy/acc\n0.67\n0.68\n0.72\n0.69\n0.74\narc_easy/acc_norm\n0.62\n0.52\n0.68\n0.65\n0.70\nddboolq/acc\n0.50\n0.56\n0.53\n0.49\n0.71\nhellaswag/acc\n0.36\n0.36\n0.63\n0.43\n0.54\nhellaswag/acc_norm\n0.66\n0.73\n0.72\n0.67\n0.73\nopenbookqa/acc\n0.29\n0.29\n0.30\n0.27\n0.30\nopenbookqa/acc_norm\n0.38\n0.41\n0.40\n0.40\n0.41\npiqa/acc\n0.75\n0.78\n0.76\n0.75\n0.77\npiqa/acc_norm\n0.76\n0.78\n0.77\n0.76\n0.78\nrecord/em\n0.88\n0.91\n0.89\n0.88\n0.90\nrecord/f1\n0.89\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.90\nrte/acc\n0.54\n0.56\n0.60\n0.58\n0.65\ntruthfulqa_mc/mc1\n0.20\n0.21\n0.23\n0.22\n0.22\ntruthfulqa_mc/mc2\n0.36\n0.34\n0.35\n0.35\n0.35\nwic/acc\n0.50\n0.50\n0.51\n0.48\n0.49\nwinogrande/acc\n0.64\n0.68\n0.67\n0.62\n0.67\nAverage\n0.51\n0.53\n0.55\n0.52\n0.56\nWe removed the task CB and WSC from our benchmark, as our model performs suspiciously well on these two tasks.

63	JPEG XL gains support by a billion+ devices	https://dennisforbes.ca/articles/jpegxl_just_won_the_image_wars.html	published	reddit	Effortlessly Support Next Gen Image FormatsSpoiler: This piece recommends that you use the picture element, prioritizing better image formats in your web applications while still supporting legacy clients. If you're already using it, you can probably click back. The verbiage below is hopefully helpful for everyone elseApple Throws In Behind JPEG XLAt WWDC 23, Apple announced that they will support JPEG XL1 in their upcoming software releases2. Not only in their new OS products, but in their Safari 17 release which can be used from macOS Monterey onwards. In mere months from now, a billion+ devices will support this best-in-class, feature-rich image format, which is a stark change from the limited support it saw previously.This is it. It's finally time to move on from the thoroughly obsolete JPEG format! No, seriously, we've talked about this for years, but now it really is the turning point.We've had broadly-supported superior formats for years in the form of WEBP and AVIF (both derived from video codecs). Supported by most major browsers, these were already a huge step up from JPEG, offering dramatically better visual performance at much higher compression levels. They did have downsides, however, notably the lack of progressive rendering, and a significantly higher computational complexity to decode versus JPEG. It was easy to pull a "no one gets fired for buying IBM" sort of fallback-to-defaults easy out and just stick with JPEG. JPEG XL has neither of those downsides. It is nothing but upside, beyond adapting your content work process slightly. In this entry I'm focused specifically on the web side of things, and how you can serve JPEG XL to capable clients with fallbacks for clients that don't yet support it, and will use the same approach to serve WEBP and AVIF as well. I use it in my own projects to prioritize SVG as well (many images are optimal in vector formats, but that's another article), offering raster fallbacks for those who need it.This is super trivial, yet I've seen users on software development boards proposing solutions such as inserting a client-sniffing reverse proxy that replaces img srcs on a need basis, or client-side feature sniffing scripts, and thankfully that sort of heavy-handed solution is entirely unnecessary.Why JPEG XL?There are loads of great resources comparing the formats, including comprehensive A:B type comparisons, so I'll simply list the major advantages of JPEG XL.Not every client is going to support every feature out of the gate — Safari 17 on iOS 17 doesn't support animations for JPEG XL yet, for instance — however with adoption these will certainly come.JPEG XL is a viable replacement for JPEGs, PNGs, GIFs, among other formats. With the prior next-gen formats there were legitimate pros and cons. With JPEG XL it is literally all upside, presuming you have the fallbacks while laggard clients catch up.Introducing the picture ElementSupported in every major browser, the picture element's primary offering was the media conditions, offering a responsive design that varied which image was used depending upon the metrics of the display device. A smaller display might load a smaller picture while a high DPI displays might load a high resolution image, and so on.The picture element supports backwards compatibility by hosting an internal img element. If the client doesn't recognize the picture and source elements, it will ignore those entirely and use the img element instead. Similarly the img will be used if none of the types or media conditions match the client.The benefit of the element that we're going to focus on is the type attribute. By specifying the mime type for a series of images in a set of picture source children, the browser will find the first image that matches its supported formats, loading and using that option. You can of course combine these with media conditions for type+responsive condition optimizations.That's it! It really is that easy.Users on the beta of iOS 17 will get the JPEG XL image. Those on Chrome and Firefox will likely get an AVIF image. Edge, despite being Chromium underneath, will fallback to the WEBP image (there seems to be a license or patent concern leading Microsoft to isolate AV1/AVIF functionality). Browsers that support none of those will get a classic, terrible JPEG.Browsers that don't understand the picture element will act as if they don't exist and simply display the img. Browsers that understand it will evaluate each line to find the first that matches a supported type and, if applicable, media criteria.From a DOM perspective the img is still king, and the resolution of the picture/source artifacts will modify the img element.And of course JPEG XL is a replacement for PNG scenarios as well. For instance a logo (in this case for my own company) where I will attempt to use the optimal vector graphic, but for those who don't support it I fallback to the hyper-efficient JPEG XL, failing that using a PNG.PNG is a fantastic format for uses like this, but still the JPEG XL is almost 1/5th the size: 9,778 bytes versus 44,530 bytes for the PNG. The SVG is close to the JPEG XL size, at 10,516 bytes, however it has the advantage of rendering perfectly at enormous resolutions.Note that the checkerboard pattern is added to the background container to demonstrate the transparency which all three of the possible formats (SVG, JPEG XL, and PNG) support.Where It Goes From HereThere is a high chance that Chrome and its various offspring (Edge, etc.) (re-)support JPEG XL3 in the near future. In fairness, I should offer up the counterpoint that Safari, both mobile and desktop, has supported JPEG2000 for over a decade with little impact on the computing world, the format still wallowing in obscurity.JPEG XL offers a much greater value proposition over classic JPEG than JPEG 2000 did, with the latter basically offering only a higher compression ratio. JPEG XL, in contrast, offers transparency, HDR, animations, additionally compressing JPEGs with zero quality loss, lossless compression, and a number of other real-world benefits that can improve many workflows and bring real benefits for end users.FootnotesSafari 17 also adds HEIF/HEIC support, which has always been a bit of a split brain situation on Apple platforms. Use iCloud Photos from Safari and it presents all of the photos as JPGs, but if you download while using a macOS client it downloads a much less compatible HEIC variant that is a pain if you need to upload it to a website, with few supporting the format. If you access the same site from a Windows machine and choose the lower quality option it gives you a JPEG version↩︎ Relative to the time that I authored this, 2023-06-07. The betas of iOS/iPadOS 17 are available now and support JPEG XL. The Safari 17 beta for macOS 12+ will be available in the coming months↩︎ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33933208 - JPEG XL support has officially been removed from Chromium↩︎ Check out libjxl↩︎ 	2023-06-08	{"title":"JPEG XL: The Future of Image Formats","article":"\\nJPEG XL, the next generation image format, has gained support from over a billion devices, including Apple's upcoming software releases and Safari 17. This is a significant milestone for the format, which has seen limited support in the past. With this new development, it's time for developers to start considering JPEG XL as the future of image formats.\\n\\nJPEG XL offers a range of benefits over its predecessor, JPEG. While JPEG has been the go-to image format for decades, it has significant limitations in terms of visual performance and compression levels. In contrast, JPEG XL offers dramatically better visual performance at much higher compression levels, making it a clear winner in terms of image quality.\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of JPEG XL is its support for progressive rendering. This means that the image can be displayed in a low-resolution version while the full-resolution version is being loaded. This is particularly useful for large images, as it allows the user to see the image quickly, even on slower connections.\\n\\nIn addition, JPEG XL has a significantly higher computational complexity to decode versus JPEG, which means that it requires more processing power to decode. However, this is offset by the fact that JPEG XL offers better compression, which means that the resulting file size is smaller than a comparable JPEG file.\\n\\nFor developers, the move to JPEG XL is relatively straightforward. The picture element, which has been around for a while, can be used to prioritize better image formats in web applications while still supporting legacy clients. This means that developers can start using JPEG XL today, safe in the knowledge that it will work on a wide range of devices.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that JPEG XL is not the only next-generation image format available. WEBP and AVIF, both derived from video codecs, have been around for a while and are already supported by most major browsers. However, JPEG XL offers a range of benefits over these formats, particularly in terms of progressive rendering.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the move to JPEG XL is an important step for developers. With support from over a billion devices, including Apple's upcoming software releases and Safari 17, it's clear that JPEG XL is the future of image formats. Developers who start using JPEG XL today will be ahead of the curve, offering better image quality and compression than their competitors. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to start using JPEG XL! \\n\\nHere's an example of how to use the picture element to support JPEG XL:\\n\\n```\\n<picture>\\n  <source type=\\"image/jxl\\" srcset=\\"image.jxl\\">\\n  <source type=\\"image/jpeg\\" srcset=\\"image.jpg\\">\\n  <img src=\\"image.jpg\\" alt=\\"My Image\\">\\n</picture>\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the browser will first try to load the JPEG XL version of the image. If it's not supported, it will fall back to the JPEG version. If neither format is supported, it will load the default image. This ensures that all users can see the image, regardless of their device or browser."}

These paper reviews can be delivered weekly to your inbox, or you can subscribe to the Atom feed. As always, feel free to reach out on Twitter with feedback or suggestions!TelaMalloc: Efficient On-Chip Memory Allocation for Production Machine Learning AcceleratorsA common pattern for integrating machine learning models with applications is deploying them to user devices, where the models run on local hardwareSee Apple’s guide to deploying transformers to the Apple Neural Engine. . Running models locally provides performance improvements (by eliminating communication with a cloud), while enabling private computing. Unfortunately, there are also challenges to running models locally because of diversity in hardware capabilities - a program that works well on the highest end modern phone may not perform optimally on previous generation devices.To effectively run on a user’s device, the software must efficiently use local resources, including memory. The problem of allocating memory has been studied extensivelySee Dynamic Storage Allocation: A Survey and Critical Review. , but ML models pose novel challenges. Specifically, memory allocation for ML models is a 2D bin-packing problemThere is a large amount of research on solving this problem - see Survey on two-dimensional packing and the Wikipedia reference. - unlike programs which grow and shrink their memory usage over time, ML models have strict requirements for memory allocations because certain parts of the model depend on others.Existing solutionsThe paper cites XLA, TFLite (optimized for mobile devices), and Apache TVM. for ML model memory allocation rely on heuristics or solvers (which can produce a closer to optimal output, but often take longer to run). The Telamalloc paper proposes a solution balancing a combination of heuristics and solvers. As a result, the research is able to tackle the challenge posed by wide variance in hardware capabilities, significantly reducing the time that it takes the model to allocate memory and run.What are the paper’s contributions?The paper makes three main contributions:How does the system work?The system takes the problem and turns it into a 2D-optimization problem, where memory blocks are assigned to different ranges of address space over time, based on the flow of the program.The authors aim the approach at tensor memory allocation both on mobile devices and in Tensor Processing UnitsSee An in-depth look at Google’s first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). , a custom piece of hardware that is used for machine learning at scale.It is worth noting how well studied resource allocation is - the paper reviews the standard approach compilers follow to:1) take a graph representation of the model and perform various graph transformations, 2) divide the graph into smaller units of work (operators), and 3) map these operators to different units of hardware.The authors call the third component the mapping problem, and note it is fundamentally different than the problem they’re focused on, which they call the memory allocation problem:the mapping problem is concerned with determining which level of a memory hierarchy to map each buffer to, the memory allocation problem selects buffer locations within addressable scratchpad memories that are shared between multiple buffers with overlapping live ranges.Notably, the performance of solving the memory allocation problem impacts users. If the compilation of a model takes a long time, an application using a model won’t work. On the other hand, if the problem is solved quickly, but suboptimally, the model may not be able to successfully allocate memory (because it attempts to use too much memory).Problem FormulationThe authors represent the problem by providing a set of buffers with start, end, and size to the allocator, along with an upper limit to memory usage.The allocator then attempts to produce a solution mapping each buffer to an address, where none of the buffers overlap, and memory usage doesn’t exceed the specified limit.Memory Allocation HeuristicsThe paper describes three main heuristics for assigning buffers to addresses: best-fit, greedy, the approach Telamalloc implements (which is a combination of both).A best-fit allocator assigns buffers to address space in start time orderThe paper mentions that Tensorflow uses this strategy with its best-fit with coalescing (BFC) allocator. . The paper notes, “This approach works well if memory is abundant but fails if the memory budget is tight” because memory allocations of many blocks in a constrained space will be suboptimal.The greedy approach (used by TFLite) takes, “the end time into account to pick locations one buffer at time, while ensuring that it does not overlap with any previously allocated buffers.” Again, this approach doesn’t do well when memory is tight because it also produces suboptimal solutions.Lastly, there is the heuristic that Telamalloc implements, which takes into account the contention of a point of time (represented by the number of buffers that need to be assigned). Buffers with the highest contention are placed first at the lowest possible address (stored by keeping a “skyline” for each time period)This is reminiscent of the Skyline Problem! . If there are multiple buffers, the heuristic makes a decision based on other factors like the length of time a buffer exists.Solver-based ApproachesHeuristics for memory allocation have several downsides, including that their performance depends on the specific workload and problem difficulty - “once a heuristic has made a wrong decision that prevents it from solving the problem, it has no way to recover.” To address the shortcomings of heuristic failure, Telamalloc integrates a solver-basedIn particular, the paper relies on integer liner programming (ILP), described in more detail here. approach that represents the problem with several constraints, including all of the buffers taking up space at a given time can not exceed memory and buffers can not overlap.Telamalloc OverviewAs mentioned earlier, Telamalloc doesn’t solely rely on heuristics, nor solvers - heuristics get stuck on certain cases, and solvers can take too long. Normally solversThe paper specifically refers to a solver framework from Google, capable of representing a wide variety of constraints and problems. return the whole solution given an input and a set of constraints - instead, the program that guides the solver integrates interactively, reading the state of the solver for a particular buffer and making choices, then responding to feedback.At each step, the Search Heuristic chooses from the remaining unplaced blocksIt chooses blocks based on the following heuristics in order, “(1) The block with the longest lifetime (end-start time). (2) The block with the largest size. (3) The block with the largest area (i.e., size × lifetime).” , and “backtracks” to undo choices if a state it ends up in is invalid. It splits backtracking into “minor” and “major” based on how many steps need to be undone - the former corresponds to a single buffer placement, whereas the latter corresponds to undoing a whole line of choices (because the final state is invalid).The authors describe a number of optimizations to implement smart backtracking. Several of these focus on avoiding a return to the conditions that caused the initial backtrack. For example, on failure to satisfy constraints, the solver reports which placements occurred, so the search algorithm can unwind them quickly. Another example optimization is explicitly prioritizing buffers whose placement (or inability to place) led to a major backtrack - “this avoids cases where the solver got stuck by ignoring blocks that were important but not among the largest or longest-lived blocks”.Lastly, Telamalloc groups together buffers that contend with one another into phases, then runs the algorithm over each phase. This approach reduces the complexity of the problem, and allows choosing from a smaller set of candidate buffers when making choices.How is the research evaluated?The paper considers two main aspects of Telamalloc: microbenchmarks evaluating the algorithm in isolation, and measurements from compiling models / making memory allocations on a Pixel 6.The microbenchmarks consider the time to compute memory placements in the best and worst cases. In normal conditions, Telamalloc completes incredibly quickly (“≈10-100us for common problem sizes”). The worst case is represented by a large number of blocks (one thousand) with full overlap - in this situation, Telamalloc takes around 100000 ms, and each step takes significantly longer due to the strain placed on the solver (which needs to consider how a candidates interacts with many different potential placements).When comparing Telamalloc’s compilation of common models on the Pixel 6 running against a solver (which is capable of achieving near-optimal results given enough time), the memory allocations Telamalloc produces are nearly identical. Telamalloc is also able to achieve a, “median speedup of ≈ 4.7× across the benchmark”.ConclusionTelamalloc is an interesting paper because it discusses a combination of existing algorithms with optimizations tailored to improve user experiences relying on ML models. The paper also discusses using ML to make the performance of “smart” backtracking better - the idea of feeding in-the-wild data back into an algorithm to improve it over time is fascinating to me. This pattern also shows up in places like Java’s JIT compiler which takes data about a program’s performance and execution, then uses that to make the program better over time. Beyond the technical details of the paper, I also appreciated its focus on the impact to users - being able to compile models efficiently and successfully across a wide range of hardware is critical to making new AI-powered capabilities accessible to all.\nFollow me on\nTwitter or subscribe\nbelow to get future paper reviews.

RING RING RIIING!"You jolt awake and silence the pager.Bleary-eyed you fire up the laptop and realize the full breadth of the problem — the whole payment system is down.\nEvery minute of debugging is costing the company thousands. Drowsiness making way for adrenaline, you try to figure out what’s going on, but it’s a big system and you just can’t seem to understand what’s happening.Several hours later – and hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue – you finally nail down the root cause:\nOne of the backend services received an unexpected request payload that caused it to exhaust a huge amount of resources, causing a death spiral and the system slowly grinding to a halt.Observability tools like Distributed Tracing are designed to help with this, but are usually limited to request metadata (HTTP method, duration, Kubernetes pod information, etc) and don't capture request/response payloads as they often contain sensitive data. You really don't want to be surprised by a credit card number flying by as you're trying to debug an issue.\nAt the same time, having access to request/response payloads would have made the incident a five minute affair.Designing a better approachNormally we “solve” this predicament in one of three ways:None of these options really solves the problem — we want all our engineers to be able to debug our systems without risking them being exposed to that information, nor putting the burden on them to write a scrubbing function for every data type.For Encore's distributed tracing we came up with what we think is a pretty neat approach that leverages static analysis to achieve what we think is a best-of-both-worlds solution. It's naturally open source. Let's take a look at how it works.Encore's distributed tracing captures request/response payloads sent as JSON payloads by default. While it would be relatively straightforward to scrub valid JSON according to a specification, a common use case of inspecting request payloads is when something goes wrong. Like sending invalid JSON. It would be bad if the scrubbing failed to scrub data because a human called the API with a trailing comma inside a JSON object, for example.To summarize the requirements:Understanding what is sensitiveEncore defines APIs in a type-safe way, similarly to gRPC, with struct types representing the request and response payloads. This has the nice property that the structure of the payloads can be statically understood by analyzing the types.To mark a field as sensitive is done with a Go struct tag. (Other languages might use annotations or macros to achieve the same effect of attaching meta-data to a field.) For example, consider an API endpoint for placing an order to purchase something. We can easily tag various parts of the request as sensitive:From this API description, Encore's static analyzer captures all this information and outputs it as a protobuf. What's nice about determining what is sensitive from the code itself is it makes it a local decision. If you had to manually configure data scrubbing in some other system it's easy to forget, whereas it's easy to do at the moment you're writing the relevant code.Implementing a streaming scrubberSo how to actually do the scrubbing? And how to handle invalid JSON? It turns out the same solution is ideal for both requirements: a streaming parser.A detour into tokenizationThe typical user-facing API for encoding and decoding JSON is: "marshal this data structure as JSON" and "unmarshal this JSON into this data structure", respectively. Simple to understand, yes, but also slow and memory-hungry: the whole data structure needs to be kept in memory.Under the hood, however, JSON parsers process the incoming bytes in a streaming way to construct a sequence of "tokens" (a process called "tokenization"), before the decoding phase takes over and needs to do a whole bunch of buffering to construct the final object. The transformation looks like this (line by line):Crucially, the tokenizer doesn't know or even care about JSON syntax rules: it just processes bytes and outputs a stream of tokens according to what it sees. For example, the (very invalid) JSON payload {"foo","bar":3] becomes OPEN_BRACE LITERAL("foo") COMMA LITERAL("bar") COLON LITERAL(3) CLOSE_BRACKET when interpreted as a sequence of tokens. It doesn't matter that "foo" doesn't have a value associated with it, or that the closing square bracket should have been a curly brace.The implementation of this (the code calls it "scanner") can be found here.Scrubbing a token streamTo scrub the data we can construct the data scrubbing to operate on this sequence of tokens instead of requiring the fully unmarshalled object, by designing the data structures carefully.The algorithm works like this.First, we use the output from the static analysis to build a list of all the fields that need scrubbing. Each list entry is a simplified version of JSONPath, and expresses the sequence of fields and array elements to get from the root of the JSON value (starting with the opening { in our case) to the field that needs scrubbing.In the PlaceOrderRequest above, the list of fields to scrub looks like this (each line being its own path expression):We can then take these path expressions and merge them into a tree. As you can see we have two lines that both start with {Kind: ObjectField, FieldName: "Billing"}. These get merged, so we end up with a tree structure that looks like this:See groupNodes implementation.Then, when processing a token stream we keep track of our current position in this scrub tree. Starting with the "Root" node as the active scrub node, we begin iterating over the token stream. Whenever we encounter an object key, we look at the children of the active scrub node to see if the object key exists as a child node. So when we encounter the token representing the object field LITERAL("Card") we notice there exists a child node in our scrub tree matching that. We recurse, updating the internal state to set the Card node as the selected node.When we continue reading the token stream we encounter the token OBJECT_KEY("Number") which we again identify as a child of our active scrub node in this case it's marked with Action: SCRUB so instead of recursing we "skip" the whole value (including any nested objects or arrays).Since all tokens include position information (offsets into the byte stream where the token starts and ends), skipping the value tells of exactly where the value started and ended. We record these positions as a byte segment that must be redacted.When we then encounter the next CLOSE_BRACE token we know the Card object has been completed, so we return back to the caller (bubble up one recursion level), updating the active scrub node to again be the Root node. We then proceed processing key-value pairs.Whenever we encounter an object field that's not listed as a child to the active scrub node we can skip over the whole value with no additional processing.When we've processed the whole byte slice we're armed with a list of non-overlapping (start, end) byte offsets that represents the byte segments to redact. From that it's straightforward to perform the redaction by replacing the bytes. By pre-computing the new length we can do so in a single allocation.The end result is a JSON byte slice that looks something like this:Handling invalid JSONBy virtue of implementing this based on the token stream it's quite straightforward to handle invalid JSON. The core idea is to try to guess the user's intent in the presence of invalid JSON.For example, the tokenizer tries to guess whether a token represents an object key or a value, based on surrounding context. Consider {"foo", "bar": true}. Is "foo" a key or a value? If "foo" is a key, is "bar" a value? Seemingly not since it's proceeded by the colon.After plenty of experimentation we came up with a heuristic that is easy to reason about and matches the user's intent quite well. We treat the first literal we encounter as an object key. Then we alternate, treating the next as the value. When we see a colon we update the previous literal to be a key and the next to be a value. In the example above, "foo" and "bar" would be considered keys and true the value for the "bar" key. We also perform other error recovery strategies, like considering strings to end at newlines, treating closing ] and } as equivalent so if they're mismatches it doesn't matter, ignoring commas entirely, and more.You can see the full suite of tests here and here, including the fuzz testing to make sure the code handles arbitrary JSON input without crashing.This approach is also much faster than actually parsing JSON. Our benchmarks indicate it's almost 50% faster than standard JSON parsing, and a single CPU core can scrub ~180MiB data/sec. That's without any serious optimization effort put in, unlike Go's standard library JSON parser.ConclusionNow we have a way to scrub a stream of data, we can use this to scrub the request and response bodies of Encore API's before sending them to Distributed Tracing or logging systems from the application. This works by computing the JSONPath expression based on the static analysis description (see implementation and tests).This means that we can safely send our data to these systems without worrying about exposing sensitive data.Future improvements we plan to make include scrubbing misspelt fields using the Levenshtein distance and detecting incorrect casing (like using camelCase when the API expects snake_case keys). We're also experimenting with suggesting redacting fields based on the field name (like Email for PII, or Password for hopefully-obvious reasons). Additional suggestions are always welcome.You can checkout the full implementation of Encore's scrubber here, and the package documentation here.More Articles	2023-06-08	{"title":"The Importance of Redacting Sensitive Data in Traces for Debugging","article":"As a developer, debugging can be a challenging and time-consuming task. When a system goes down, every minute counts, and the root cause needs to be identified as quickly as possible. However, in the process of debugging, sensitive data can be exposed, which can lead to security breaches and compliance issues. This is where redacting sensitive data from traces becomes crucial.\\n\\nTraces are a valuable tool for debugging distributed systems. They provide a detailed view of the system's behavior, including request metadata, such as HTTP method, duration, and Kubernetes pod information. However, they also capture request/response payloads, which can contain sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and personal information.\\n\\nTo avoid exposing sensitive data during debugging, redacting techniques can be used. One way to achieve this is through static analysis, which involves analyzing the code to identify sensitive data and replacing it with a placeholder. Another method is through JSON tokenization, which involves converting the sensitive data into a token and replacing it in the trace.\\n\\nRedacting sensitive data from traces not only helps to maintain security and compliance but also enables developers to share traces with other team members without worrying about exposing sensitive data. It also helps to reduce the risk of data breaches, which can be costly and damaging to a company's reputation.\\n\\nOne programming language that has been gaining popularity in the industry is Rust. Rust is a systems programming language that provides memory safety and thread safety while maintaining high performance. It is designed to be fast, reliable, and secure, making it an ideal language for developing systems that require high levels of security and performance.\\n\\nRust has a strong focus on memory safety, which means that it prevents common programming errors, such as buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences. This makes it a great language for developing secure systems that handle sensitive data. Rust also has a strong type system, which helps to prevent type-related errors, such as type coercion and type mismatch.\\n\\nIn addition to its strong focus on security, Rust also has a growing community of developers who are contributing to the language's ecosystem. There are many libraries and frameworks available for Rust, making it easier for developers to build complex systems.\\n\\nOne example of a Rust library that can be used for redacting sensitive data is the Rustc-serialize library. This library provides a JSON serializer and deserializer for Rust, which can be used to tokenize sensitive data in traces. Another example is the RustCrypto library, which provides cryptographic primitives for Rust, making it easier to implement secure systems.\\n\\nIn conclusion, redacting sensitive data from traces is an essential practice for maintaining security and compliance in distributed systems. Using techniques such as static analysis and JSON tokenization can help to avoid exposing sensitive data during debugging. Rust is a programming language that provides memory safety and thread safety while maintaining high performance, making it an ideal language for developing secure systems. With its growing community and ecosystem, Rust is becoming an increasingly popular choice for developers who value security and performance."}

1368	A New GraalVM Release and New Free License!	https://medium.com/graalvm/a-new-graalvm-release-and-new-free-license-4aab483692f5	published	reddit	A New GraalVM Release and New Free License!Alina YurenkoFollowgraalvm--6ListenShareOracle GraalVMWe are introducing a new distribution — Oracle GraalVM. It is available for JDK 17 and JDK 20 and released under the GraalVM Free Terms and Conditions (GFTC) license (also see the FAQ). This means that you can use all the greatest GraalVM features, both for development and in production, for free!For Native Image, in this release we are introducing:GraalVM Native Image is already known for its instant startup, but with this release we can demonstrate that it is also an incredibly efficient way to run long-running Java applications with high performance. We have tested our release on a Java 20 Spring PetClinic example application compiled with GraalVM Native Image, and compared it to JIT compilation, with the following performance benefits:Now let’s look closer at each of those performance metrics.Native Image is known for the fastest application startup times. Thanks to additional compiler optimizations with Oracle GraalVM, startup goes to the next level:Thanks to additional memory optimizations, our benchmark application built with Oracle GraalVM Native Image uses significantly less memory:The peak throughput of Oracle GraalVM Native Image here is 1.6x higher than GraalVM CE. For this specific application, the throughput is still slightly below JIT. When running other benchmarks with Spring, as well as Quarkus and Micronaut, in many cases we see AOT even ahead of JIT for peak throughput.Another metric important to evaluate for your application is efficiency: how much performance you can get for a given amount of time and resources. This is especially relevant for the cloud, where you pay for resources and how long you are using them, but even on-prem you want to use your infrastructure efficiently. To evaluate this, let’s look at how many requests our application can process per GB of memory per second (see the chart above):This means that with Oracle GraalVM Native Image you can get the best peak throughput for the infrastructure you have, or run with good performance even in resource-constrained environments.Now let’s look into latency distributions. Latency is a critical metric that reflects the responsiveness of all requests of your application. The slowest requests are visible in the tail latency distribution and impact greatly the quality of service. Usually, business requirements mandate a specific latency limit for most of the requests (typically 99%, i.e. the P99 latency).Here we see that up until the 95th percentile Oracle GraalVM Native Image and CE JIT with C2 have very similar response times under 3 ms. This means that you can expect the same responsiveness of your application with Native Image as with JIT. However, the highest percentiles degrade significantly on the JIT while they stay low with Native Image. So for this application Native Image provides a significantly better P99 latency, and therefore improved responsiveness of the service.In summary, Oracle GraalVM Native Image provides excellent performance characteristics for long-running applications in addition to fast startup and low resources usage.We’ve also been working on many new features in this release. Since we have so many updates, we have two blog posts: this one focuses on GraalVM JDK and Native Image, and we have another for GraalVM languages and Truffle updates.Now let’s see what else is new in this release!GraalVM for JDK 17 and JDK 20GraalVM now has a new naming scheme that is aligned with JDK versioning — for example, this release includes two GraalVM versions: GraalVM for JDK 17 and GraalVM for JDK 20. Both versions are based on the main branch and contain new features, so you can choose the JDK version that works best for you. However, we encourage you to move to JDK 20 — as we announced some time ago, we are transitioning to a new release schedule, in which we’ll release GraalVM only for the latest Java version (just like Oracle JDK does). This way you can also use all the latest Java and GraalVM features together.Another great update in this release is that the GraalVM JDK download now includes Native Image! No need to download Native Image as a separate component or run gu install native-image — it’s ready from the get-go.And downloading Oracle GraalVM got easier as well — we now have stable scriptable download URLs, so you can use them to download directly, or in your scripts and Docker files. For example, to get Oracle GraalVM for JDK 20 on Linux x86–64, run the following command:Machine Learning for Compiler OptimizationsOne of the very helpful features available in Oracle GraalVM is profile-guided optimization (PGO). PGO enables you to collect an application’s profiling information at runtime and then use it with Native Image to optimize the performance of the resulting native executable. It enables you to combine the best of both worlds: the power of AOT optimizations together with runtime profiling.One of the exciting new features in this release is machine-learning-based profile inference. Native Image now uses a pre-trained ML model to predict the probabilities of the control flow graph branches. Then, we use the predicted probabilities to perform PGO. In our measurements on a comprehensive set of benchmarks such as Renaissance, Da Capo, and Da Capo con Scala, PGO powered by the predicted profiles provides ~6% runtime speedup compared to the default Native Image configuration. ML-based profile inference is available in Oracle GraalVM, enabled by default, and we are looking forward to your feedback and performance reports.However, remember that ML profile inference might slightly increase the size of the native executable file by 1–2%.Even More Performance in Native ImageOne of the ways a compiler can provide better performance is by leveraging the architecture-specific features of your deployment platform. Using those specific features is great for performance, but may pose compatibility challenges when deploying on machines without those specific instructions. We introduced a new -march option, similar to gcc, that gives you the flexibility to choose between platform-specific performance and compatibility: -march=compatibility for best compatibility, or -march=native for best performance if the native executable is deployed on the same machine architecture or on a machine with the same CPU features. To list all available machine architectures, use -march=list.We’ve also made several changes to profile-guided optimizations:Native Image BundlesThe Native Image build command (native-image -jar MyApp.jar) may look simple on the surface, but it initiates a complex build process with many variables and properties that depend on the environment. It would be very helpful to be able to replicate a build — for example, for updating and patching your applications, or reproducing issues. For that purpose, this release introduced Native Image Bundles. Now you can produce a build bundle that contains a JAR file of your application along with information about arguments, environment variables, system properties settings, classpath and module-path options. To produce a bundle, use the — bundle-create=<imagename>.nib flag when building a native executable. This will produce the actual executable just like before, along with a <imagename>.nib file and the <imagename>.output directory. Having those files available, you can then reproduce the build by running the following:Bundles should simplify updating Native Image deployments and help with debugging and reproducing issues. Give this feature a try and let us know what you think!Build reportsNative Image now can generate build reports that help you better understand the contents of your executables. The build reports come in HTML format and provide insights into the following:Use -H:+BuildReport to try this new experimental feature.AWT on LinuxWe’ve improved AWT support in Native Image: in addition to Windows, it now works on Linux! This means that more GUI Java applications will now work on Native Image. We are looking forward to seeing your applications running with Native Image and your feedback. Improved AWT support for macOS is also on the way.Native Image Developer ExperienceWith every release we are introducing updates to make the developer experience with GraalVM, and in particular Native Image, more smooth and streamlined. There are several changes in this release:New Monitoring Features in Native Image 📈By a popular demand, together with the community we implemented remote management over JMX. It can be enabled with the --enable-monitoringoption, for example: --enable-monitoring=jmxclient,jmxserver. Note that this feature is experimental.Ready for Native Image ✅Sometimes we get a question “how do I know whether I can use a library X with Native Image”. Now at graalvm.org you can find a list of libraries and frameworks that are tested to work with Native Image out of the box. At the moment, the list contains more than 150 such libraries and frameworks that are verified to work with Native image, including Micronaut, Spring, Quarkus, Helidon, H2, GraphQL, MariaDB, Netty, MySQL, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Testcontainers, Thymeleaf, and many others. We are glad to see our ecosystem actively adopting Native Image and providing support for it, in particular via the GraalVM-reachability-metadata repository. This repository is also integrated with Native Build Tools, so it’s now possible to automatically discover and pull Native Image configuration files for your dependencies.GraalVM JDK and Compiler UpdatesCommunity ContributionsWhat’s New in the GraalVM EcosystemConclusionWe want to take this opportunity to thank our community for all the feedback, suggestions, and contributions that went into this release.

One such practice is making small, feature-based commits instead of large, sweeping changes. In this article, we'll explore why feature commits are better than large commits, and how they can help improve your development workflow.\\n\\nThe Advantages of Small Commits in Code Development\\n\\nLet's look at the benefits that come with adopting a small commit approach in your development process:\\n\\n1. Better Code Quality\\n\\nSmall, feature-based commits allow developers to focus on a single feature or bug fix at a time, rather than trying to tackle multiple changes in a single commit. This approach leads to cleaner, more modular code that is easier to understand and maintain.\\n\\n2. Easier to Review\\n\\nWhen you make small commits, it's easier for your team members to review your code changes. They can quickly understand what changes you made and why you made them. This makes the review process faster and more efficient.\\n\\n3. Easier to Collaborate\\n\\nSmall commits make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase without stepping on each other's toes. Each developer can work on their own feature or bug fix, and then merge their changes into the main codebase without causing conflicts.\\n\\n4. Easier to Debug\\n\\nWhen you make small commits, it's easier to track down bugs and issues in your code. You can isolate the changes that caused the problem and quickly roll back those changes if necessary. This makes debugging faster and more efficient.\\n\\n5. Better for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\\n\\nSmall commits are better for CI/CD because they allow you to test and deploy changes more frequently. With large commits, you may have to wait longer to test and deploy your changes, which can slow down your development process.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, adopting a small commit approach in your development process can lead to better code quality, easier code reviews and collaboration, faster debugging, and a more efficient CI/CD process. So, the next time you're working on a feature or bug fix, consider making small, feature-based commits instead of large, sweeping changes. Your team members (and your future self) will thank you."}

(Help) button to get the\nfollowing information.\nMouse Button Actions\nClick left mouse button on a shader thumbnail to run the shader in place.\nTip: when you do this, move the pointer out of the thumbnail area to allow the\ncontrol panel to go away. If you desire the control panel to always be shown,\nhold down the Ctrl key on keyboard while doing the above mouse click. If\nyou want any possible sound muted, hold down both Ctrl and Shift while\ndoing the above mouse click. If you want to see a larger version of the\nthumbnail (and not run the shader), hold down the Shift key while doing the\nabove mouse click. Note: once you run a shader, these options are no longer\navailable for that shader unless you reload the page via either the\n"Reload page" option of the "Results Per Page" button or any other\nfeature that refreshes the page. Larger versions are also shown if\n"1 per page" is selected with the Results Per Page button. Note:\nthumbnails may all be different sizes, due to the fact that the thumbnail is\ncreated at the point of their shader's run (and characteristics (i.e. window\nsize) of that run) in which their shader is saved.

Click on the L to open up a new browser tab to it's\nshadertoy.com page.\nLimitations and Why You Would Want to Use This Tool\nThis search tool will ONLY find/show shaders that have the API permission set.\nThis isn't due to this search tool, it is due to shadertoy.com's API and the\nobvious desire to allow the shader's author to decide how/if their shader can\nbe accessed. Because of this, this search tool isn't a replacement for\nshadertoy.com by any means - just a useful tool. For example, because it\ndoesn't automatically run any shader, it can be faster, and perhaps more\nimportantly safer (ever have your computer or graphics card crash due to a\nshader? I have), to go through the search results.\nPossible Improvements\nThere are some things that could be improved (either by me or by someone else\ninclined to do so). One improvement would be to remove the reliance on\njQuery. The hardest part would be to replace getJSON with the\nequivalent AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) code or even the fetch function. The rest\nwould be easy. I've made two versions that don't use jQuery.\nstoysearch-no-jquery.html uses fetch instead of .getJSON and\nstoysearch-no-jquery-no-fetch.html uses XMLHttpRequest instead of .getJSON\nor fetch (some browsers don't have fetch).\nYou might notice that my javascript code isn't always consistent in how it does\ncertain things. This is partly because I believe in reusing code I've already\nwritten and partly because I wanted to show that there are many different ways\nof doing the same thing. Much of github is meant for teaching/learning after\nall. My only requirement is that the different ways must not require the most\nup-to-date browsers.

It is crucial to organize the code in a way that makes it easy to manage and maintain. Separating the state management into its own module is an effective way to do this.\\n\\nIn this article, we will show you how to separate state management into its own module in vanilla JavaScript. We will provide you with an example that you can use in your own projects.\\n\\nTo begin with, we will create a file called store.js, which will contain the state management code. The first step is to define the initial state. In our example, we will create a state object that contains a count property, which is initialized to 0.\\n\\n```\\n// Define the initial state\\nlet state = { count: 0 };\\n```\\n\\nNext, we will define a list of subscribers. These are functions that will be called whenever the state changes. In our example, we will create an empty array called subscribers.\\n\\n```\\n// Define a list of subscribers\\nlet subscribers = [];\\n```\\n\\nWe will then define a function called setState, which will update the state and notify the subscribers. The function takes a new state object as an argument and updates the state variable. It then loops over the subscribers array and calls each function with the new state object.\\n\\n```\\n// Define a function to update the state and notify subscribers\\nfunction setState(newState) {\\n  state = newState;\\n  // Notify subscribers\\n  for (let i = 0; i < subscribers.length; i++) {\\n    subscribers[i](newState);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe will also define a function called subscribe, which allows other parts of the application to subscribe to state changes. The function takes a callback function as an argument and adds it to the subscribers array.\\n\\n```\\n// Define a function to subscribe to state changes\\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\\n  subscribers.push(callback);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFinally, we will export the state, setState, and subscribe functions so that they can be used in other parts of the application.\\n\\n```\\n// Export the state, setState, and subscribe functions\\nexport { state, setState, subscribe };\\n```\\n\\nNow that we have defined the state management code in store.js, we can use it in other parts of the application. In our example, we will create a file called main.js, which will contain the code that uses the state management module.\\n\\nFirst, we will import the state, setState, and subscribe functions from store.js.\\n\\n```\\nimport { state, setState, subscribe } from './store.js';\\n```\\n\\nWe will then subscribe a function that updates the DOM to state changes. In our example, we will update the count element with the new count value.\\n\\n```\\n// Subscribe a function that updates the DOM to state changes\\nsubscribe(function(newState) {\\n  document.getElementById('count').textContent = \\"Count: \\" + newState.count;\\n});\\n```\\n\\nNext, we will define a function called incrementCount, which will increment the count property of the state object by 1.\\n\\n```\\n// Define a function to increment the count\\nfunction incrementCount() {\\n  setState({ count: state.count + 1 });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFinally, we will call the incrementCount function to increment the count value.\\n\\n```\\n// Call the function to increment the count\\nincrementCount();\\n```\\n\\nBy separating the state management into its own module, we have made it easier to manage and maintain the code. We can now add more functionality to the state management module without affecting the rest of the application.\\n\\nIn conclusion, separating state management into its own module is an effective way to organize code in vanilla JavaScript. It makes it easier to manage and maintain the code as the application grows. The example we provided can be used as a starting point for your own projects."}

Also, I know at least one amazing product written in Rust for Python — Pola.rs, which easily beats Pandas. Likely, there are others that I don’t know.I use PyO3 extensively in our software: you may check my Similari, FFmpeg-Rust, or Savant-Rs modules that we use in our computer vision framework, Savant, to find how various problems can be solved with PyO3. However, I’m a toy Rust programmer, so don’t judge the code too critically 😄.For a long time, I struggled to document the extensions to help users observe only those parts that are available in Python without looking at the Rust source code.In my first extension, I just wrote a markdown file with API:Definitely, not the best possible approach. It can work, however, if the exported API is tiny and easy to remember. But recently, I wrote a large extension with many symbols exported to Python — savant-rs. It is a large API; it definitely scratched my head when I thought I needed to tell fellow developers to go to Rust code to read the comments and predict how various symbols will be used from Python. So, I started researching how to document Python-exported pieces of code and generate the documentation for them: unfortunately, there's almost no information about that. However, I stumbled upon a discussion on PyO3 GitHub where a reasonable idea appeared.Initially, the proposal was to use “.pyi” interface files and document them:However, I didn’t like the proposed approach because it requires you to do things twice in two different places (Rust code and PYI files, which are optional). Luckily, later in the discussion, someone nicknamed “Haaroon” wrote:It appeared to be a holy grail of documenting. What is the Napoleon extension? It is an introspection-based documentation extractor developed to automatically document NumPy in Spinx with embedded docstrings.It was exactly the tool I was looking for, so I went to Haaroon’s profile to find what projects they worked on. There I found Pometry/Raphtory, where they used it. I started experiments with my code and am now ready to share the results with you.The prologue ends here: I begin to share how to make a well-documented native extension for Python with Rust.How ToWe will use the Sphinx documentation builder to generate beautiful documentation. We need the Napoleon extension to extract the documentation from our native library.I created a small stub Rust/PyO3 project, where I demonstrated how to tie the pieces of the whole picture together. The project is located on GitHub.In the project two parts: rust extension library under the extension directory and docs under docs.The extension is generated cargo new --lib extension , and all PyO3 infrastructure files are filled to support building with Maturin.The documentation is generated with sphinx-quickstart , but first, the Sphinx requirements must be installed with pip:Let us begin with the extension documentation and generate HTML for it. I usually like when my extensions include version information right from the crate, so I wrote a simple version() function in extension/src/lib.rs :Let us document it. It can be done as follows:As you can see, we utilize Rust’s documentation blocks but with Sphinx’s RST syntax. This code will not normally display when published to Crates.io.I want to use the version function in the Sphinx documentation, so I imported it to my docs/source/conf.py as depicted:Of course, you need to build and install the wheel to make it work. I provide ready-to-use Makefile in the project root:It builds the extension project, installs it in the VENV, and builds the docs. If everything is fine, you can access the documentation with its entry point docs/build/html/index.html. Magic! You must see all the symbols:Let us document the module itself:Regenerate the documentation (make), and voila! Now you can see module-level documentation strings:Let us document the add function:Recompile everything with make and update the page:Now, it is time to document MyClass, begin with the new:Regenerate the documentation, aaand… nothing happens. It doesn’t work: you will not see any documentation changes. I wasn’t able to make it work, so my workaround is to have a static method as demonstrated:It works:You may need a disclaimer for extension users about the workaround. Another way is to document it on the struct level:It works:Great, the add method can be documented in the same way as it is done for theadd function so that I will skip it.Well, we see that we have a struct member value with the getter assigned. How can we document it? Let us begin with a most straightforward approach:The result is:If you implemented getters and setters with #[getter] and #[setter] , annotate only one of them because when both are documented, only the docstring for getter is shown:Result:Basically, you need to explain the use of getter and setter in the getter’s docstring.ConclusionUsing Sphinx with Napoleon makes it easy to document native Python extensions created with Rust and PyO3. Certain things may not work as expected, and limitations exist, but the tool provides the most convenient and effortless approach to documenting and publishing the source code.Nb. GitHub’s Copilot is a great help in documenting the code. Thanks to Haaroon for sharing their wisdom.----Written by Ivan KudInside In-SightCTO in the wildHelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeams	2023-06-19	{"title":"Documenting Python Extensions Made with Rust and PyO3","article":"\\nPython is a popular programming language, but sometimes developers need to write native extensions to optimize their code.

In this article, we will discuss how to document Python extensions made with Rust and PyO3.\\n\\nIvan Kud, a developer who uses PyO3 extensively in his software, faced the challenge of documenting the extensions to help users observe only those parts that are available in Python without looking at the Rust source code. He initially wrote a markdown file with API, but this approach was not suitable for large APIs. \\n\\nTo solve this problem, Ivan used Rustdoc, a tool that generates documentation for Rust code.

130	Visual Studio Code May 2023	https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79	published	reddit	Version 1.79 is now available! Read about the new features and fixes from May.UpdatesMay 2023 (version 1.79)Downloads: Windows: User System Arm64 | Mac: Universal Intel silicon | Linux: deb rpm tarball Arm snapWelcome to the May 2023 release of Visual Studio Code. There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like, some of the key highlights include:If you'd like to read these release notes online, go to Updates on code.visualstudio.com.Insiders: Want to try new features as soon as possible? You can download the nightly Insiders build and try the latest updates as soon as they are available.AccessibilityVerbosity settingsAdditional accessibility.verbosity settings have been added to inform screen reader users how to interact with features when they are focused.For GitHub Copilot, there are hints describing how to access the accessible help menus for the Copilot chat view and in editor code chat via:These help menus provide information about what to expect, how to navigate from the input box to other elements, and more.Other new verbosity settings provide information for specific VS Code UI:The accessibility.verbosity settings are enabled by default (set to 'true') but you can silence them individually.Settings editorVoiceOver on macOS now reads the descriptions of enum setting options in the Settings editor. Try it out with enum settings such as files.autoSave and editor.accessibilitySupport.WorkbenchReadonly modeIn some development scenarios, it can be helpful to explicitly mark some of a workspace's folders or files as read-only. For example, if the folder or file contents is being managed by a different process (such as the node_modules folder that is managed by Node.js package manager), marking them are read-only can avoid inadvertent changes.For this use case, there are new settings to mark file paths as read-only in the Explorer and in text and notebook editors:According to the rules of the settings, if a path is considered to be read-only, you cannot modify it from the Explorer (for example, delete it) and the text or notebook editor is read-only.For more ad-hoc toggling of the read-only mode, there are new commands to change the mode for the current session only, overruling your setting configurations:Windows UNC host allowlist improvementsAs part of an important security fix, VS Code introduced an allowlist for UNC hosts. This milestone we addressed many of the usability problems reported by Windows users when they have UNC paths in their day to day work with VS Code.Dialog improvementsThe confirmation dialog to allow a UNC host on startup now updates the security.allowedUNCHosts setting and adds the host when you select the checkbox.In addition, clicking the Learn More button no longer closes the dialog.New security.restrictUNCAccess settingA new setting security.restrictUNCAccess lets you disable the UNC allowlist for hosts and restore the behavior to how it was before this security fix. We strongly advise against changing this setting, as it makes your system vulnerable again to the Information Disclosure Vulnerability.New tab sizing option fixedThe workbench.editor.tabSizing setting has a new option fixed that makes each tab equal width. When space becomes limited, tabs will shrink equally up to a minimum. The new setting workbench.editor.tabSizingFixedMaxWidth sets the initial size of the tab.In this mode, when you rapidly close tabs using the mouse, the widths of tabs remain stable to allow for closing each tab by clicking onto the same point. The width is then adjusted when you leave the mouse from the editor tab area.Network quality indicationWhen you are connected to a remote machine, the best experience for VS Code remote editing capabilities requires a good network connection with low latency. In this milestone, we updated the remote indicator in the Status bar to give you some feedback when either latency is very high or the network connection appears to be offline.High latency (web, desktop)We periodically measure the latency to the remote you are connected to. When a certain threshold is hit, the remote indicator updates to reflect that.Offline detection (web only)If you are using a web browser to connect to a remote and you suddenly lose internet connection, the remote indicator updates to reflect that.Continue Working OnThe Continue Working On feature allows you to store and retrieve working changes between VS Code development environments for the same repository, for example, when you upgrade from a local Git repository to a GitHub codespace, or when you switch between different machines for the same repository.You can now transfer working changes between development environments for a GitHub repository even if it is configured with an HTTP remote in one environment and an SSH remote in another. Additionally, we have started to transfer additional workbench state, such as your Source Control view state preference, for a more seamless transition.EditorPaste asWhen pasting a file into a text editor, there are multiple ways you might want to insert it. You may want an absolute path point to the file. You may want a path relative to the current workspace. Or you may even want something specific to the current editor's language, such as inserting a Markdown link to the file when pasting into Markdown. VS Code's new 'paste as' functionality gives you control over how the pasted content is inserted.After pasting, VS Code now shows a small 'paste as' control if there are other ways the pasted content could have been inserted:You can open the 'paste as' control by clicking on it or using the ⌘. (Windows, Linux Ctrl+.) keyboard shortcut. The paste selector goes away as soon as you start typing or move the cursor outside of the inserted text. You can also fully disable the drop selector control using "editor.pasteAs.showPasteSelector": "never".When you paste content into a Markdown cell in a notebook, for example, the 'paste as' control lets you switch between:If you prefer selecting how content in the clipboard should be pasted before actually pasting, you can instead use the new Paste As... command. This lets you select how the content should be pasted:Quick suggestions and snippetsQuick suggestions mean that VS Code shows suggestions as you type, without having to press ⌃Space (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Space). This feature is widely popular, around 90% of all suggestion sessions are started by typing. A large number of suggestions are accepted via Tab (versus Enter and typing accept characters).When a snippet is being inserted, the Tab key is used to navigate between snippet placeholders. Now, when quick suggestion becomes active while a snippet is being inserted, the Tab key can accept a completion or navigate to the next snippet placeholder. To resolve this conflict, there is the editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions setting to disable quick suggestions when a snippet is inserted. It defaulted to true and as long as this setting existed, we received feedback that it was confusing. So we have decided to change its default value to false, so that typing inside a snippet placeholder will trigger quick suggestions.You can then use the following keystrokes:TerminalAutomatic shell integration for fish shellShell integration and its enhanced user experience will now automatically activate for fish shell. You may need to update fish for this to work.Overline supportThe overline escape sequences (SGR 53, SGR 55) specified in ECMA-48 are now supported in the terminal. The most common use of this sequence is to add a line above an app's "status bar" on the bottom row of the terminal.Source ControlDefault branch nameStarting with this milestone, all new Git repositories created using VS Code set main as their default branch. If you prefer a different name for the default branch, you can change it with the git.defaultBranchName setting. When the setting is set to empty, VS Code defers to the default branch name configured in Git. Publishing a folder to GitHub also honors the default branch name configured on GitHub.Branch picker integration with vscode.dev and GitHubYou can now checkout a branch in vscode.dev or open it on GitHub.com from the branch picker on VS Code desktop.In the short video below, each branch listed in the branch picker dropdown has buttons on the right to either Open on GitHub or Checkout on vscode.dev.Similarity thresholdGit status uses a similarity index (number of additions/deletions compared to the file's size) to determine whether an add/delete pair is considered a rename. You can now configure the similarity threshold with the git.similarityThreshold setting, which takes a value between 0 and 100. The default value is 50.NotebooksRich content searchYou can now search for rich content in open notebooks from the Search control. If your notebook is open, the Search control shows results based on how it appears in the notebook editor (rather than searching the content of the raw source file). This also allows for replacing text in the notebook inputs.Using the new notebook search toggle, you can also filter which types of cell content you would like to search in.Improved cell output interactionThe new context key notebookOutputInputFocused was added to determine if a text box within a cell output has focus, so that raw hotkeys a/b/j/k can safely be used while the output has focus. Focusing on an input box prevents those hotkeys from triggering.Format on RunNotebooks now can format cells upon cell execution. This will trigger using Run Cell, Run All, Run Above/Below, and combined kernel+run commands. This feature can be turned on via setting "notebook.formatOnCellExecution": true.Code Actions on saveNotebooks now support Code Actions being run upon save. Code Actions can be specified under the notebook.codeActionsOnSave setting. Extension authors can define providers using the standard typings for cell level Code Actions, or use the new notebook. prefix to define Code Actions that manage the entire notebook. You can review the clean-nb-imports-ext sample extension to learn how extensions can use this new setting.LanguagesTypeScript 5.1VS Code now ships with TypeScript 5.1.3. This major update brings new TypeScript language features, better performance, and many important improvements and bug fixes. You can read about TypeScript 5.1 on the TypeScript blog.Linked editing for JSX tagsWith linked editing, when you change an opening JSX tag VS Code will automatically update the corresponding closing tag. This can be a great time saver:The feature is off by default but can be enabled by setting:You can also explicitly start linked editing with the Start Linked Editing command.Rename matching JSX tags using F2When you trigger rename on a JSX tag, VS Code now renames just the matching tag instead of trying to update all references to the tag:This requires TypeScript 5.1+ and matches how rename works in HTML.You can disable this behavior using javascript.preferences.renameMatchingJsxTags and typescript.preferences.renameMatchingJsxTags.JSDoc @param completionsWhen writing JSDoc comments, VS Code now shows suggestions for all missing parameters:This can help you quickly fill in the documentation.In JavaScript files, @param completions create placeholders for the parameter type description:Copy external media files into workspace on drop or paste for MarkdownWant to add an image or video into a Markdown document? Instead of wasting time first manually copying the file into your workspace and then adding a link to it, now you can just drop or paste the file into your Markdown. If the file currently isn't part of the workspace, VS Code will automatically copy the file into your workspace and insert a link to it:This also works great for image data in the clipboard. For example, if you take a screenshot with the Snipping tool on Windows, you can press Paste in a Markdown file and VS Code will create a new image file from the clipboard data and insert a Markdown image link to the new file. This also works on macOS if you hold the Ctrl key while taking a screenshot to copy it to the clipboard.You can also customize the behavior of this feature using a few settings:markdown.copyFiles.destinationThe markdown.copyFiles.destination setting controls where new media files are created. This setting maps globs that match on the current Markdown document to image destinations. The image destinations can also use some simple variables. See the markdown.copyFiles.destination setting description for information about the available variables.For example, if we want every Markdown file under /docs in our workspace to put new media files into an images directory specific to the current file, we can write:Now when a new file is pasted in /docs/api/readme.md, the image file is created at /docs/api/images/readme/image.png.You can even use simple regular expressions to transform variables in a similar way to snippets. For example, this transform uses only the first letter of the document file name when creating the media fileWhen a new file is pasted into /docs/api/readme.md, the image is now created under /docs/api/images/r/image.png.markdown.copyFiles.overwriteBehaviorThe markdown.copyFiles.overwriteBehavior setting controls whether newly created media files overwrite existing files.By default, VS Code will never overwrite existing files. Instead if you have a file called image.png and try pasting it into a Markdown document in a workspace where an image.png already exists, VS Code will instead create a new file called image-1.png. If you then try pasting another file called image.png, it will instead be created as image-2.png.If you prefer having existing files be overwritten by new files, set "markdown.copyFiles.overwriteBehavior": "overwrite". Now VS Code will always use the original file name, overwriting any existing files that that path.Disabling copying files into the workspaceVS Code will only try copying files into your workspace if they are not already part of workspace. Additionally, we currently only copy media files (images, videos, audio) into the workspace.However if you find this new behavior too intrusive, you can disable it for both drop and paste by setting:IntelliSense for HTML paths in Markdown filesMany Markdown dialects allow raw HTML tags to be used in Markdown documents. In this update, we've extended most of VS Code's Markdown IntelliSense features to file paths used in these HTML tags. This includes support for:Insert audio into MarkdownWhen you drag and drop or copy and paste an audio file into a Markdown document, VS Code now inserts an <audio> element.Syntax highlighting for JSON with Lines (JSONL) filesJSON with Lines describe a sequence of JSON objects separated by newline characters. If the file extension jsonl is used, VS Code provides syntax highlighting.Remote DevelopmentThe Remote Development extensions, allow you to use a Dev Container, remote machine via SSH or Remote Tunnels, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.Highlights include:You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the Remote Development release notes.Contributions to extensionsGitHub CopilotNote: To get access to the chat view and inline chat, you'll need to sign up for the GitHub Copilot chat waitlist.Use Copilot Chat in Stable VS CodePreviously, you had to use VS Code Insiders to use Copilot Chat. As of VS Code 1.79, you can use Copilot Chat in stable VS Code as well. You will still have to install the GitHub Copilot Nightly extension.Editor chatWe have improved editor chat, most notably we have changed its default mode to be "livePreview". In this mode, changes are applied directly to the document and shown with an embedded diff view. Let's look at the example below:Notebook improvementsWe have improved the chat experience in notebook editors this month. When using Copilot in a notebook document, Copilot can use the notebook context to provide more relevant suggestions. For example, the code suggestions use variables or modules defined in previous cells without recreating or re-importing them.When running notebook cells, Copilot now also provides suggestions for cell execution failures. You can display these by selecting the Fix using Copilot action on the cell status bar.The Copilot suggestions are also accepted automatically on cell execution, so you don't have to accept them manually.GitHub Pull Request and Issues integrationWhen the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension is installed and enabled and you are viewing a review thread, it is now possible to directly apply a review comment using Copilot. You can do this via the Apply Suggestion with AI button in the comment menu.Experimental Quick Question experienceTheme: Panda Theme (preview on vscode.dev)This iteration, we experimented with using chat to ask quick programming questions without leaving context. If you have access to the chat experience, you can enable this feature with the following setting:Feature overview:Delete chat entryYou can now delete a chat request/response pair by clicking the X icon in the chat request.Why would you want to do this? Sometimes, Copilot provides a response that is off topic or incorrect. You can ask your question again, but removing the bad response from your session's chat history may also help keep the conversation on track. There is also a limit to the amount of context that can be included with each chat request, so removing a long poor response might help save your context budget for more useful information.Move chat session from sidebar to editorIt was already possible to open a chat session in an editor by running the Chat: Open Editor command, but now it is also possible to move chat sessions back and forth between the sidebar and editor. You can find the Open Session in Editor and Open Session in Sidebar commands under the "..." menu in the chat view title or the editor title menus.Chat session historyYour chat sessions are now saved to history, which you can browse by selecting the Show History button in the chat view title menu. You can select a history entry to load that conversation into a chat editor, and then seamlessly continue where you left off. You can remove sessions from history by clicking the X button on each row.Export chat sessions to JSON fileWe've added a command, Chat: Export Session, which exports the current focused chat session to a JSON file. You can then run the Chat: Import Session command to import this session and continue your conversation. You can check this file into your repo, share it with others, or just save your conversation for reference later. Note that when you are continuing your conversation in an imported chat session, those new messages won't be saved unless you export the session again.Codeblock navigation and keybindingsWe've added some commands and keybindings that make it easier to work with codeblocks in chat responses. Chat: Next Codeblock (F9) and Chat: Previous Codeblock (⇧F9 (Windows, Linux Shift+F9)) move the cursor to the next or previous codeblock in the current chat response. When a codeblock is focused, the commands in the codeblock toolbar can also be invoked from the Command Palette, or you can assign keybindings to them. Run in Terminal has a keybinding assigned by default, ⌃Enter (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+Enter). And the Copy command will now be run when you press the normal copy keybinding in the codeblock without having a selection.We've also added keybindings to focus the chat window (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)) and to clear the chat session (⌃L (Windows Win+L, Linux Ctrl+L)).Copilot YouTube playlistTo learn more about GitHub Copilot as well as tips and tricks and best practices, have a look at the VS Code Copilot Series on YouTube. There you'll find an introduction to GitHub Copilot, language-specific usage, and guidance on effective prompting when using Copilot for development.PythonRun Python file in dedicated terminalThe Python extension will now create a new terminal for each file you run using the Run button on the top of the editor or the Python: Run Python File in Terminal command, and will keep using this file's "dedicated" terminal every time you re-run it.Any time you wish to run the same file in a separate terminal, you can run select Python: Run Python File in Dedicated Terminal under the Run button menu.Test discovery and run rewriteThis month, we are beginning the roll out of our testing rewrite as an experiment. This rewrite redesigns the architecture behind test discovery and execution for both unittest and pytest in the extension. While it does not provide any additional functionality exposed to the user, it reduces buggy behavior and opens up new functional opportunities moving forward. The rewrite is being rolled out behind the experiment pythonTestAdapter, which you can opt in and out of using python.experiments.optInto in your settings.json. Eventually, we plan to remove this setting and adopt this new architecture. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding this experiment or rewrite, you can share them in the vscode-python repository.Configurable indexing limits with PylanceThere's a new Pylance setting that allows you to configure the file count limit for indexing: "python.analysis.userFileIndexingLimit", which is set to 2000 by default. This setting can be helpful when working with very large projects and you're willing to compromise performance for an enhanced IntelliSense experience.JupyterResume execution of cells against remote Jupyter kernelsThe Jupyter extension now supports resuming execution of cells against remote Jupyter kernels, if the cell is still busy executing, even when reopening the Notebook after having shutdown VS Code.For instance, assume you execute a long running section of code such as training of a model against a remote Jupyter kernel. This could take a few minutes or longer, so you might decide to shut down VS Code in the interim. A few minutes later VS Code is restarted with the same notebook opened and if the cell is still busy executing, this state is reflected in the Notebook cell and any new output is displayed in the cell output.If on the other hand, the cell completed execution while VS Code was shut down, the outputs generated in the interim would not be preserved in the notebook. Resuming executions in this manner and displaying new output is limited to simple output such as plain text, HTML, images, images, and the like. Restoring the state of widgets and other such complex outputs is not supported.GitHub Pull Requests and IssuesThere has been more progress on the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Highlights include:Review the changelog for the 0.66.0 release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.Preview featuresProject wide JS/TS IntelliSense on insiders.vscode.devvscode.dev is a lightweight version of VS Code running fully in your browser. This iteration, we've significantly enriched vscode.dev's JavaScript and TypeScript support so that it can analyze all files in your workspace instead of being limited to currently opened files. This greatly improves navigation through code, letting you Go to Definition and Find All References to a symbol. It also improves IntelliSense by making sure settings from your tsconfig.json / jsconfig.json are respected. We even now support auto-imports while writing code.In the image below, the References view is displaying all references to ITextDocument in the workspace.These new IntelliSense features work for folders you open from your local machine and in GitHub repos you open using vscode.dev's built-in GitHub Repositories extension.Keep in mind that there are still a few limitations with JS/TS IntelliSense on vscode.dev:We plan on addressing these limitations going forward, and are excited to continue enriching our JavaScript and TypeScript support on the web!Images in the terminalThere is now experimental support for images in the terminal. Images in a terminal typically work by encoding the image pixel data as text, which is written to the terminal via a special escape sequence. The current protocols that are supported are sixel and the inline images protocol pioneered by iTerm.Enable this feature by setting:Once enabled, to test it, you can download and cat a .six example file from the libsixel repository:Or use the imgcat python package or imgcat script with a png, gif or jpg file:The current limitations of this feature are:TypeScript 5.2 supportThis update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.2 release. Check out the TypeScript 5.2 iteration plan for more details about what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Some exciting upcoming tooling highlights include:To start using the TypeScript 5.2 nightly builds, install the TypeScript Nightly extension.Move to file refactoring for JavaScript and TypeScriptThe Move to file refactoring in TypeScript 5.2 nightly lets you move a class, function, or constant into an existing file. This will also automatically update all references to the symbol and also update imports as needed:When you select Move to file, VS Code shows you a list of all files in the current TypeScript or JavaScript project. You can start typings to quickly find the file you want.Alternatively, you can use Select existing file... to select a file using the normal file picker or Enter new file path... to specify a new file that should be created.This feature is still being actively developed, so give it a try and share your feedback!WebAssemblies in VS Code for the WebTo add more programming language support to vscode.dev, the VS Code team has been investigating how to run general WebAssembly in VS Code for the Web. If you are interested in this approach and want to learn more, check out the recent VS Code and WebAssemblies blog post.Extension authoringImproved vscode.fs performance for local filesWhen you are using vscode.fs API to work with files (you should!), operations to files that are local to the extension host will now resolve much faster.Previously the extension host would delegate these operations to the VS Code client for execution, but now they execute directly inside the extension host, saving round trips.Stricter Status bar APIThe API to create a Status bar item createStatusBarItem lets extensions pass an identifier. This identifier is used to control hiding and showing the Status bar item. The identifier should be unique for the extension but until now this wasn't enforced. With this release, we make this a little more strict and Status bar items that are created by the same extension with the same identifier will now be merged into one.TasksThe task presentation option to close the terminal on task completion has been finalized.Proposed APIsEvery milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.EnvironmentVariableCollection.descriptionThis proposal allows specifying a description for EnvironmentVariableCollection, displayed to the user in the terminal tab hover, explaining what exactly the change is doing.EnvironmentVariableMutator.optionsThis proposal adds options that can be provided to EnvironmentVariableMutators, allowing you to specify exactly when the environment variable change is applied, either on process creation or in the shell integration script (after shell init scripts have run).Share providerThe Share API proposal allows extensions to provide ways to share resources in VS Code.Share provider results are currently surfaced as a top-level Share... Command Palette action and as a new icon near the Command Center, provided you have opted in with "workbench.experimental.share.enabled": true and "window.commandCenter": true.You can leave feedback in the API proposal issue #176316.Static Status bar itemsStatus bar items can now be contributed statically via package.json#contributes/statusBarItems. With this contribution point, an extension can delay its activation and only activate when the Status bar item is interacted with, for example, on the command. Once activated, extensions can access their static Status bar items via the vscode.window.createStatusBarItem API.workspace.save and workspace.saveAsThe Save Editor API proposal allows extensions to trigger the flow of saving an editor either to its resource or by asking the user to provide a resource.All the methods for saving will return the resulting Uri or undefined if the operation was canceled. Untitled files will always ask the user for a destination unless a path is already associated.Authentication authGetSessions proposed APIAs we move closer to having Multiple GitHub account support, we have a new proposed authentication API that lets your extension get all accessible sessions for a specific set of scopes. The proposal for these API additions has several things to call out:There is still more work involved to make this ready for adoption in the GitHub Authentication extension so if you're interested, you can follow along and provide feedback in the issue that tracks this proposal.Window Activity APIA new API is available to notify extensions if the window becomes active or inactive. This can be used to dispose of or create persistent resources or processes that can be idled to save resources.This is implemented by the addition of a new active boolean to the existing WindowState type.EngineeringElectron sandbox enabled for all usersWe are happy to announce that the Electron sandbox is rolling out to all of our users. This was a journey that started in early 2020 and now finally comes to an end. You can refer to the Migrating VS Code to Process Sandboxing blog post for more details.Extension host restart participationCertain actions in the workbench can lead to the extension host restarting without reloading the current window. For example, when you switch profiles, VS Code restarts the extension host to handle running a different set of extensions for that profile.Some custom and notebook editors however may no longer be functional after having switched profiles because a required extension is not installed in that profile. If the editor has unsaved changes, this could cause data loss. As a fix, components in VS Code can now participate in extension host restarts and make sure any unsaved changes are saved before the extension host restarts.We plan to further develop this experience in the next milestone so stay tuned for more!Windows 8 and 8.1 support has endedAs mentioned in our v1.77 release notes, v1.79 is the last release that supports Windows 8 / Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to our FAQ for additional information.Milestone automationWe have implemented automated milestone replication throughout all of our GitHub repositories. This means that the monthly milestones established in microsoft/vscode serve as the foundation for all other milestones that are created and maintained.VS Code at Microsoft BuildIf you didn't get a chance to watch Microsoft Build 2023 live, you can catch up on the keynotes and sessions on the Microsoft Developer YouTube channel.Some sessions of particular interest to VS Code users include:Notable fixesThank youLast but certainly not least, a big Thank You to the contributors of VS Code.Issue trackingContributions to our issue tracking:Pull requestsContributions to vscode:Contributions to vscode-css-languageservice:Contributions to vscode-js-debug:Contributions to vscode-pull-request-github:Contributions to monaco-editor:In this update, there are 17 sectionsIn this update	2023-06-08	{"title":"Visual Studio Code May 2023 Release Notes","article":"The May 2023 release of Visual Studio Code (version 1.79) is now available for download.

Quote reply edited {{editor}}'s edit {{actor}} deleted this content . {{editor}}'s edit Something went wrong. Tao-VanJS Jun 9, 2023 Maintainer - Hi Fellow VanJSers,\nI'm happy to announce the release of VanJS 0.12.0. 🎉🎉🎉\n0.12.0 is a major release, with the implementation of several long-waited features as well as some performance optimizations.\n1. Polymorphic binding\nIf you use VanJS to build reusable components, it's desirable for the users to specify both state and non-state property values while building the components. For instance, for a reusable Button component like that:\nconst Button = ({color, ...}) = button( ...\n)\nit would be desirable for Button to accept both static color value and color state. If the property value is being used as the property value of a DOM element, or as a child node, things can work out of the box. However, prior to this release, State-derived properties and van.bind only support state objects as dependencies, which means if the color property is used like that:\nbutton({ style: {deps: [color], f: color => `background-color: ${color};`}, ...\n}, ...)\nyou can only pass-in state objects for color property, as non-state objects won't work for State-derived properties. This release solves the issue by allowing both state and non-state property values being used as dependencies for State-derived properties and van.bind. With this feature, you can build both static and dynamic Button components:\nconst Button = ({color, text, onclick}) => button({ style: {deps: [color], f: color => `background-color: ${color};`}, onclick,\n}, text)\nconst App = () => { const colorState = van.state("green") const textState = van.state("Turn Red") const turnRed = () => { colorState.val = "red" textState.val = "Turn Green" onclickState.val = turnGreen } const turnGreen = () => { colorState.val = "green" textState.val = "Turn Red" onclickState.val = turnRed } const onclickState = van.state(turnRed) return span( Button({color: "yellow", text: "Click Me", onclick: () => alert("Clicked")}), " ", Button({color: colorState, text: textState, onclick: onclickState}), )\n}\nTry on jsfiddle\n2. SVG/MathML support\nIn this release, we introduce a new function van.tagsNS to support the creation of SVG, MathML or other HTML elements with namespaceURI. For instance, you can build a smiley face with SVG elements now:\nconst {circle, path, svg} = van.tagsNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg")\nconst Smiley = () => svg({width: "16px", viewBox: "0 0 50 50"}, circle({cx: "25", cy: "25", "r": "20", stroke: "black", "stroke-width": "2", fill: "yellow"}), circle({cx: "16", cy: "20", "r": "2", stroke: "black", "stroke-width": "2", fill: "black"}), circle({cx: "34", cy: "20", "r": "2", stroke: "black", "stroke-width": "2", fill: "black"}), path({"d": "M 15 30 Q 25 40, 35 30", stroke: "black", "stroke-width": "2", fill: "transparent"}),\n)\nTry on jsfiddle\nand also math formulas with MathML elements:\nconst {math, mi, mn, mo, mrow, msup} = van.tagsNS("http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML")\nconst Euler = () => math( msup(mi("e"), mrow(mi("i"), mi("π"))), mo("+"), mn("1"), mo("="), mn("0"),\n)\nTry on jsfiddle\nGreat thanks to @andrewgryan for providing the intial draft implementation of this feature.\n3. Support readonly properties while creating HTML elements\nPrior to this release, readonly properties of HTML elements (e.g.: the list property of an <input> element) can't be set properly. This release solves the problem. Thus the code below will work now:\nconst Datalist = () => div( label({for: "ice-cream-choice"}, "Choose a flavor: "), input({ list: "ice-cream-flavors", id: "ice-cream-choice", name: "ice-cream-choice", }), datalist( {id: "ice-cream-flavors"}, option({value: "Chocolate"}), option({value: "Coconut"}), option({value: "Mint"}), option({value: "Strawberry"}), option({value: "Vanilla"}), )\n)\nTry on jsfiddle\n4. Performance optimizations\nIn this release, we replace forEach call with for (... of ...) loops for better performance. Meanwhile, we disable the terser optimization for wrap_func_args as the optimization is obsolete in newer browser versions.\nWith all the added features and performance optimizations, the minimized bundle size increases slightly to 1.3kB (1365 bytes), while still holding the title of the smallest reactive UI framework in the world.\n❤️ Hope you can enjoy!

Quote reply Tao-VanJS Jun 10, 2023 Maintainer Author - 0.12.1 was just released.\n0.12.1 is a minor release of VanJS.\nIn this release, we support null and undefined as the child node of tag functions and van.add. null or undefined valued children will be simply ignored in tag functions and van.tag. This feature is added as a result of feedback from multiple VanJS users as they mentioned the feature can make the user-side code easier in certain circumstances. This feature also makes VanJS's behavior consistent between static child node and child node with state bindings (where null or undefined means the removal of the node).

This is a bug fix of the 0.12.1 release.\nBundle size reduction: specifically optimizing the bundle size for features added in 0.12.0 and 0.12.1 releases.

In this article, we will explore what they are, why they are used, and how they differ from API Gateways.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nWebhooks are a type of reverse API, meaning that they reverse the usual flow of communication between a client and a server. Instead of the client requesting data from the server, the server sends data to the client when a specific event occurs. This is where Reverse-API Gateways come in.\\n\\nWhat are Reverse-API Gateways?\\nA Reverse-API Gateway is a tool that sits between a webhook provider and a webhook consumer. It acts as a reverse and forward proxy for webhooks.

It can handle webhook events multiplexing and de-multiplexing, which can help to reduce the complexity of webhook management. Additionally, it can provide features like load balancing, caching, and security.\\n\\nArchitecture of Reverse-API Gateways\\nThe architecture of a Reverse-API Gateway is similar to that of an API Gateway. It consists of a set of servers that act as a reverse and forward proxy for webhooks. The servers can be deployed in a cluster to provide scalability and high availability.\\n\\nAPI Gateways vs Reverse-API Gateways\\nAPI Gateways are designed to handle API requests, while Reverse-API Gateways are designed to handle webhook requests. API Gateways provide features like authentication, rate limiting, and circuit breaking, while Reverse-API Gateways provide features like webhook management, load balancing, and caching.\\n\\nConclusion\\nReverse-API Gateways are becoming increasingly popular in the world of software development. They provide a centralized location for webhook management and can handle webhook events multiplexing and de-multiplexing. Additionally, they provide features like load balancing, caching, and security. If you are working with webhooks, it is worth considering using a Reverse-API Gateway to help manage them."}

However, it would be possible in every backend server frameworks, soon. Preface\nIn nowadays, I've developed a NestJS backend server simulator in my library nestia.\nFor reference, the simulator does not connect to remote backend server. It just validates request data and constructs response data, by itself. Therefore, frontend developers can start application development only with API interfaces, even if the backend server is not ready.\nBelow is a piece of SDK (Software Development Kit) code, generated by nestia, supporting the simulation mode. AS you can see, the simulator be activated just by configuring IConnection.random value to be true. Otherwise, the SDK would connect to the remote backend server.\n/** * @packageDocumentation * @module api.functional.bbs.articles * @nestia Generated by Nestia - https://github.com/samchon/nestia */\n//================================================================\nimport { Fetcher } from "@nestia/fetcher";\nimport type { IConnection } from "@nestia/fetcher";\nimport typia from "typia";\nimport { NestiaSimulator } from "./../../../utils/NestiaSimulator";\nimport type { IBbsArticle } from "./../../../structures/IBbsArticle";\n/** * Update an article. * * @param section Section code * @param id Target article ID * @param input Content to update * @returns Updated content * * @controller BbsArticlesController.update() * @path PUT /bbs/:section/articles/:id * @nestia Generated by Nestia - https://github.com/samchon/nestia */\nexport async function update( connection: IConnection, section: string, id: string, input: update.Input,\n): Promise<update.Output> { return !!connection.random ? update.simulate( connection, section, id, input, ) : Fetcher.fetch( connection, update.ENCRYPTED, update.METHOD, update.path(section, id), input, );\n}\nexport namespace update { export type Input = IBbsArticle.IStore; export type Output = IBbsArticle; export const METHOD = "PUT" as const; export const PATH: string = "/bbs/:section/articles/:id"; export const ENCRYPTED: Fetcher.IEncrypted = { request: false, response: false, }; export const path = (section: string, id: string): string => { return `/bbs/${encodeURIComponent(section ??

Mock-up data composition would be automated by the simulator, and backend developers may focus on the business logic like API interface designs and main program developments.\nLike below example code, just define only API interfaces. Then, builds simulator and delivers to frontend developers. Then you backend developer can implement application at the same time with frontend developers in parallel.\nFor referecen, nestia also can generate e2e test functions automatically. Therefore, if you've succeeded to determine API specs, you can concentrate only on the main program development.\n@Controller("bbs/articles")\nexport class BbsArticlesController { @TypedRoute.Post() public async store( @TypedBody() input: IBbsArticle.IStore, ): Promise<IBbsArticle> { return typia.random<IBbsArticle>(); }\n} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Software Development Kit\nIn traditional software development, frontend developers recognize backend server API spec by reading Swagger Documents or similar one like RestDocs. By the way, as frontend developers are not robots but humans, reading and re-writing API specs in frontend application is a very annoying and error-prone work.\nnestia also can generate Swagger Documents, and it is much evolved than traditional NestJS. However, I recommend NestJS backend developers to utilize SDK library much more, for frontend developers\nIn nestia case, it can generate SDK (Software Development Kit) library for frontend developers. As you can see from above example code, the SDK library is very simple and easy to use. Only import and function call statements are required. The SDK library will make frontend development much safer through type hints. NestJS backend server simulator also provided by the SDK library.\nBy the way, how nestia generates the SDK library? The secret is on your source code. nestia reads your NestJS backend server code directly (especially controllers), and analyzes which API routes are provided, and which DTO types are being used.\nAfter these analyses, nestia writes fetch functios for each API routes, and import statemtns that are used in each controller classes. The SDK library is generated by such source code analyses and combininng fetch functions and import statements.\nThe NestJS backend server simulator, it is just a little extension of such SDK library. AOT Compilation\nBy the way, in the previous #Summary section, I'd told that nestia is much easier than traditional NestJS. I'd told that when defining DTO schema, nestia needs only pure TypeScript type, but traditinal NestJS needs triple times duplicated definitions.\nLooking at below example DTO schema definitions, you may understand what I am saying.\n//----\n// Traditional NestJS needs 3x duplicated definitions\n//----\nexport class BbsArticle { @ApiProperty({ type: () => AttachmentFile, nullable: true, isArray: true, description: "List of attached files.", }) @Type(() => AttachmentFile) @IsArray() @IsOptional() @IsObject({ each: true }) @ValidateNested({ each: true }) files!: AttachmentFile[] | null;\n}\n//----\n// Besides, nestia can understand pure TypeScript type\n//----\nexport interface IBbsArticle { /** * List of attached files. */ files: IAttachmentFile[] | null;\n}\n//----\n// Therefore, advanced NestJS controller code can be\n//----\n@Controller("bbs/articles")\nexport class BbsArticlesController { @TypedRoute.Post() public async store( @TypedBody() input: IBbsArticle.IStore, ): Promise<IBbsArticle> { // just fine with pure interface // // validation is 25,000x times faster // JSON serialization is 200x faster ... }\n} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nLooking at above example code, someone may ask me:\n"Hey Samchon, how to validate the IBbsArticle.IStore type?\nIf a client requests with invalid data, is it possible to reject? As you know, TypeScript interface does not have any schema info in the runtime, and it is the reason why traditional NestJS has enforced developers to define triple times duplicated DTO schemas."\nHowever, my answer is "It is enougly possible". Also, even in this case, the secret is on your source code.\nWhen you compile your NestJS backend servere, nestia will analyze your source codes, and analyzes how DTO schemas are being composed. Reading your DTO schemas and traveling properties of them, nestia will generate validation and JSON serialization codes for each API routes.\nLooking at below compiled code, it is dedicatedly optimized for IBbsArticle.IStore type. It's the secret of nestia, which does not require triple times duplicated DTO schema definitions, but requires only pure TypeScript type. Also, such compile time optimization through source code analyzing is called, "AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation".\n__param(2, core_1.default.TypedBody({ type: "assert", assert: input => { const __is = input => { const $is_custom = core_1.default.TypedBody.is_custom; const $is_url = core_1.default.TypedBody.is_url; const $io0 = input => "string" === typeof input.title && 3 <= input.title.length && 50 >= input.title.length && "string" === typeof input.body && (Array.isArray(input.files) && input.files.every(elem => "object" === typeof elem && null !== elem && $io1(elem))); const $io1 = input => (null === input.name || "string" === typeof input.name && 255 >= input.name.length && $is_custom("minLengt", "string", "1", input.name)) && (null === input.extension || "string" === typeof input.extension && 1 <= input.extension.length && 8 >= input.extension.length) && ("string" === typeof input.url && $is_url(input.url)); return "object" === typeof input && null !== input && $io0(input); }; if (false === __is(input)) ((input, _path, _exceptionable = true) => { const $guard = core_1.default.TypedBody.guard; const $is_custom = core_1.default.TypedBody.is_custom; const $is_url = core_1.default.TypedBody.is_url; const $ao0 = (input, _path, _exceptionable = true) => ("string" === typeof input.title && (3 <= input.title.length || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".title", expected: "string (@minLength 3)", value: input.title })) && (50 >= input.title.length || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".title", expected: "string (@maxLength 50)", value: input.title })) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".title", expected: "string", value: input.title })) && ("string" === typeof input.body || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".body", expected: "string", value: input.body })) && ((Array.isArray(input.files) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".files", expected: "Array<IAttachmentFile>", value: input.files })) && input.files.every((elem, _index1) => ("object" === typeof elem && null !== elem || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".files[" + _index1 + "]", expected: "IAttachmentFile", value: elem })) && $ao1(elem, _path + ".files[" + _index1 + "]", true && _exceptionable) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".files[" + _index1 + "]", expected: "IAttachmentFile", value: elem })) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".files", expected: "Array<IAttachmentFile>", value: input.files })); const $ao1 = (input, _path, _exceptionable = true) => (null === input.name || "string" === typeof input.name && (255 >= input.name.length || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".name", expected: "string (@maxLength 255)", value: input.name })) && ($is_custom("minLengt", "string", "1", input.name) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".name", expected: "string (@minLengt 1)", value: input.name })) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".name", expected: "(null | string)", value: input.name })) && (null === input.extension || "string" === typeof input.extension && (1 <= input.extension.length || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".extension", expected: "string (@minLength 1)", value: input.extension })) && (8 >= input.extension.length || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".extension", expected: "string (@maxLength 8)", value: input.extension })) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".extension", expected: "(null | string)", value: input.extension })) && ("string" === typeof input.url && ($is_url(input.url) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".url", expected: "string (@format url)", value: input.url })) || $guard(_exceptionable, { path: _path + ".url", expected: "string", value: input.url })); return ("object" === typeof input && null !== input || $guard(true, { path: _path + "", expected: "IBbsArticle.IStore", value: input })) && $ao0(input, _path + "", true) || $guard(true, { path: _path + "", expected: "IBbsArticle.IStore", value: input }); })(input, "$input", true); return input; } })), Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nFor reference, such AOT compilation optimization is much light and faster than general logics accessing to each properties through for (const key in obj) statements like traditional NestJS. Measuring benchmark, it's 25,000 times faster.\nAbout this secret (static access vs dynamic access), I'll write another article later. This is related to v8 engine optimization, and I can sure that it would be much interesting than any other stories. Random Generator\nIf you've read my article carefully, you may understand how to simulate response data, by yourself. Yes, the response data also be composed by AOT compilation skill. Let's read the simulator (SDK) code again, then you can find that typia.random<T>() function be used. The typia.random<T>() is the last secret of nestia generated simulator. It generates random response data by analyzing the response DTO type.\n/** * @packageDocumentation * @module api.functional.bbs.articles * @nestia Generated by Nestia - https://github.com/samchon/nestia */\n//================================================================\nimport { Fetcher } from "@nestia/fetcher";\nimport type { IConnection } from "@nestia/fetcher";\nimport typia from "typia";\nimport { NestiaSimulator } from "./../../../utils/NestiaSimulator";\nimport type { IBbsArticle } from "./../../../structures/IBbsArticle";\n/** * Update an article. * * @param section Section code * @param id Target article ID * @param input Content to update * @returns Updated content * * @controller BbsArticlesController.update() * @path PUT /bbs/:section/articles/:id * @nestia Generated by Nestia - https://github.com/samchon/nestia */\nexport async function update( connection: IConnection, section: string, id: string, input: update.Input,\n): Promise<update.Output> { return !!connection.random ? update.simulate( connection, section, id, input, ) : Fetcher.fetch( connection, update.ENCRYPTED, update.METHOD, update.path(section, id), input, );\n}\nexport namespace update { export type Input = IBbsArticle.IStore; export type Output = IBbsArticle; export const METHOD = "PUT" as const; export const PATH: string = "/bbs/:section/articles/:id"; export const ENCRYPTED: Fetcher.IEncrypted = { request: false, response: false, }; export const path = (section: string, id: string): string => { return `/bbs/${encodeURIComponent(section ??

However, frontend developers often face challenges when working with backend servers that are not yet ready, or when they need to test their code without connecting to a live backend server. This is where the NestJS Backend Server Simulator comes in.\\n\\nJeongho Nam, a developer and contributor to the NestJS community, has developed a library called Nestia that provides a backend server simulator for NestJS. With this library, frontend developers can build a backend server simulator with just one line of code, without the need for a live backend server.\\n\\nThe Nestia library allows frontend developers to start development even if the backend server is not ready. This is a game-changer for frontend development, as it saves time and resources that would otherwise be spent waiting for the backend server to be ready. The simulator also eliminates the need for the backend server to waste time on mock-up data composition.\\n\\nHere's an example of how to use the NestJS Backend Server Simulator:\\n\\n```\\nconst article: IBbsArticle = await api.functional.bbs.articles.store(\\n  { \\n    random: true, // activate simulator\\n    host: \\"http://127.0.0.1\\", // not important when simulating\\n  },\\n  \\"notice\\",\\n  {\\n    title: \\"Hello, world!\\",\\n    content: \\"This is a test article.\\",\\n  },\\n);\\n```\\n\\nIn addition to the backend server simulator, Nestia provides many other convenient and powerful features that can help frontend developers increase their productivity and gain both high performance and easy development. Some of these features include:\\n\\n- Automatic end-to-end (e2e) functions generator\\n- NestJS simulator for frontend developers\\n- SDK library for frontend developers\\n\\nThe automatic e2e functions generator is a particularly useful feature that allows developers to generate e2e test functions automatically, saving time and effort. The NestJS simulator for frontend developers provides a simulated environment that mimics the behavior of a live backend server, allowing developers to test their code without connecting to a live server.\\n\\nOverall, the NestJS Backend Server Simulator provided by Nestia is a powerful tool that can help frontend developers save time and resources while increasing their productivity. With its easy-to-use interface and powerful features, it is a must-have for any developer working with NestJS."}
22	Announcing C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code	https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code/	published	reddit	 Announcing C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code Tim Heuer June 6th, 202319 17\nWe are thrilled to announce the preview release of C# Dev Kit, a new Visual Studio Code extension that brings an improved editor-first C# development experience to Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nThe C# Dev Kit is designed to enhance your C# productivity when you’re working in VS Code. It works together with the C# extension, which has been updated to be powered by a new fully open-source Language Server Protocol (LSP) host, creating a performant, extensible, and flexible tooling environment that easily integrates new experiences into C# for VS Code. The source repo for this extension is in the process of being migrated and will be available later this week.\nTry out C# Dev Kit for your C# web and cloud-native projects and share your feedback today!\nWhat is C# Dev Kit?\nC# Dev Kit borrows some familiar concepts from Visual Studio to bring a more productive and reliable C# experience to VS Code. This ensures a great experience whether you are quickly editing a C# file, learning C#, or debugging a backend API. The C# Dev Kit consists of a set of VS Code extensions that work together to provide a rich C# editing experience, AI-powered development, solution management, and integrated testing. As shown in the graphic below, C# Dev Kit consists of:\nThe C# extension, which provides base language services support and continues to be maintained independent of this effort.\nC# Dev Kit extension, which builds from the foundations of Visual Studio to provide solution management, templates, and test discovery/debugging.\nThe IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extension (optional), which brings AI-powered development to the editor.\nManage your projects with a new solution view\nCustomers often praise the power of project management with C#, so like Visual Studio, C# Dev Kit adds a new Solution Explorer view that works alongside the VS Code existing workspace view. This addition provides a curated and structured view of your application for effortless, central project management. This lets you quickly add new projects or files via templates to your solutions and easily build all or part of your solution.\nTest your projects with expanded Test Explorer capabilities\nWith C# Dev Kit, your tests in XUnit, NUnit, MSTest, and bUnit will be discovered and organized for you more easily for fast execution and results navigation. The extension will discover and surface your tests in the Test Explorer pane just like for your other languages. It can also be run via the command palette.\nExperience improved performance and reliability\nC# Dev Kit is powered by the recently updated open-source C# extension, now powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) Host, also open source. The C# extension is built on the incredible foundation started with OmniSharp by the amazing OSS community. Both extensions integrate with components like Roslyn and Razor to deliver superb performance for tools such as IntelliSense, definition and symbol navigation, syntax highlighting, refactoring, and code formatting.\nPrevious Time to IntelliSense\nNew Time to IntelliSense\nPercentage Improvement\n38 seconds\n3.5 seconds\n91%\nBenchmarked using a 2GB sized solution with 40 projects and 500,000 lines of source code.\nIn addition to the performance and reliability gains provided by the updated C# extension, C# Dev Kit lets you enjoy these same performance improvements with the solution, debugging, and testing features.\nWrite your project faster with AI-powered C# development\nAuto-installing as part of C# Dev Kit, the IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extension enhances the AI-assisted support beyond the basic IntelliSense code-completion found in the existing C# extension. It brings powerful IntelliCode features, such as whole-line completions and starred suggestions, putting what you’re most likely to use at the top of your IntelliSense completion list to your C# projects, all based on your own personal codebase.\nDevelop C# apps from anywhere\nIt’s never been easier to create modern .NET applications while working on your favorite operating system.

1374	Keeping Apollo Cache up-to-date after mutations	https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/keeping-apollo-cache-up-to-date-after-mutations	published	reddit	Keeping Apollo Cache up-to-date after mutationsA discussion of approaches to keep Apollo cache consistent with the API data after invoking GraphQL mutations.Apollo Client is a JavaScript\nGraphQL client commonly used in React applications. It facilitates communication\nwith a GraphQL backend in a convenient way and enhances user experience thanks\nto caching.In this article, we go over ways to keep the Apollo Cache up-to-date after\nsuccessful data mutations.Apollo's normalized cache and its benefitsOne of Apollo's features is a normalized cache. When configured right, it\ndetects situations where 2 different query results returned parts of the same\nentity, and merges those results into a single object in memory.This means that when there is an overlap between 2 queries, the result of the\nlater query can update the values read by the earlier query, if those fields\nhappened to have changed in the meantime.Notice how the UserComponent updated and read the latest age (pointed to by\nthe blue arrow) that was fetched by a query initiated by a different component\n(UserAgeComponent). This is thanks to Apollo's knowledge that both queries\nrefer to the same object in memory, so updates propagate to all readers,\nprovided\nthe query fetch policy permits using the cache.The Apollo cache is also normalized. This means multiple different fields can\nrefer to the same object in memory.The band CFowl is referenced both in the list of\nAlice's likedBands, and as her favoriteBand. Apollo\ncan identify\nthat it is, in fact, the same band, and thus stores that as a single object in\nmemory, rather than two different objects that just happen to look the same.When CFowl releases a new song, if Apollo Cache\nlearns about it, all components that subscribed to that information will get\nupdated, regardless of how Apollo found out about the songs property having\nchanged.Such a normalized cache is useful when building user interfaces. We often\ndisplay the same data in multiple places and benefit from storing the freshest\ndata for components to use, ensuring UI consistency.Note that for normalization to work, we need to tell Apollo how to identify\nobjects of a given type, so it can check if 2 objects should be treated as the\nsame entity conceptually.\nThe documentation covers that in great detail.In the case of Splitgraph's GraphQL API, most of the time we can rely on the\nnodeId field of objects, but we could have also used the same fields that we\nuse for the selectionSet during\nschema-stitching (for example, cache User\nobjects based on their username).Keeping the cache up-to-dateAll would be well, except for the fact most applications are not read-only.\nUsers can change the content of the application and expect it to propagate\nthroughout the UI.As we all know,\ncache invalidation is one of the 2 hard problems in computer science\n(others being naming things, and off-by-1 errors, pun intended).More concretely, when a mutation successfully finishes, we should update the\ncache so components display the updated data.\nApollo documented available approaches:Let's go over these and see their pros and cons.Including modified data in the mutation's responseEach GraphQL mutation exposes information back to the caller. Mutation responses\nare merged into the cache the same way query responses are.This means that for simple mutations that update existing objects, it should be\nenough to return the updated data and let Apollo merge it into the normalized\ncache.For example, when updating the description of a repository, notice how the\ndescription property is included in the repository in the mutation response:This approach requires no additional network requests, since the updated data is\nincluded in the response to the original mutation request. There is also no\nextra work required by the application - the cache is updated automatically.It is not the Holy Grail, though. It is difficult to express insertions or\ndeletions in this way.For example, when creating a new repository, the mutation response would have to\ncontain all the possible lists in which the repository could exist. The\nsituation is similar when deleting repositories. This could easily lead to\noverfetching, since the UI most likely does not need all these lists. It just\nneeds to update the lists is already had in the cache.Updates to lists are easier to express using other approaches of Apollo cache\nupdates. Let's move on to them now.Updating the cache directly in the frontendWhen executing a mutation in Apollo, we can supply\nan update function.\nIt will be called with the mutation response and can modify the normalized data\nin the cache in any way we want. For example, this lets us add or remove objects\nfrom lists.The function runs in the browser and does not require any additional network\ncalls, which makes it fast (unless you do lots of computations in your update\nfunction, but still, it is synchronous).Again, not the Holy Grail. The syntax for cache updates is quite verbose. We\nalso run the risk of updating the cache in a way that differs from what the API\nwould return. Moreover, we need to modify all the data that the mutation could\nhave changed. This increases the risk of displaying inconsistent data.Let's see if these problems could be solved by refetching queries.Refetching queriesThe third way of updating the cached data that Apollo supports is\nrefetching queries.\nAfter a mutation is done, Apollo can refetch a set of queries to read the latest\ndata.This approach results in the highest consistency with the API, since we refresh\nthe data directly from the source. The cost is that there are additional network\nrequests involved, which use up the user's bandwidth, and take time, during\nwhich the user sees stale information.There are a two main ways to specify which queries to refetch, each with its\nupsides and downsides.Manually specify queries to refetchThe most basic way is to manually specify the queries to refetch in\nthe refetchQueries array.\nIt initially requires very little work, since you only need to specify either\nquery names, or can refetch active or all queries (using\nthe apolloClient.refetchQueries function).The ease of use comes at a maintenance cost:Both of these downsides make this solution hard to maintain. To achieve full\nconsistency, each mutation needs to be reviewed when adding, modifying, or\nremoving GraphQL queries. This adds coupling between components that normally\nshould not know about each other.All in all, it is easy to start with this approach of manually specifying\nqueries to refetch, and we recommend switching to the other solution (described\nbelow) as the application grows.Mark cached fields as invalidThe other approach is a twist of the earlier approach of updating the cache in\nthe frontend. The difference is that instead of modifying the cached values\nin-place,\nwe mark them as invalid.\nApollo will then refetch queries that included these fields in their previous\nresults.This approach scales better to more queries and mutations, and it does not\nintroduce additional coupling between components. If the updateCache function\nis implemented right and correctly approximates the effects of the mutation,\nApollo will then refetch all queries which returned those invalidated fields.The ease of use of this method depends on the type of mutation. Let's see that\non an example. Consider the following GraphQL response:It represents a Seafowl database with its contents. It is\nused in the sidebar of\nthe Splitgraph Console.Updating an existing objectLet's suppose we want to rename the lakes table to waters and assume that\nthe API cannot include the updated object in the mutation response. Thus, we\nsend a mutation:Then, after the mutation is done, we can refetch all queries that referenced the\nname field of that affected table:This seems like overkill, because we could have updated the cache directly\ninstead of refetching the queries. Still, refetching queries after updates of\nexisting objects is easy, assuming we can cache.identify the lakesTable.Deleting an existing objectLet's consider a different type of mutation. Instead of updating the table name,\nwe want to delete the lakes table altogether. We send the following mutation:Again, after the mutation is done, we can refetch all queries that referenced\nany field of the deleted table:This is just right. Apollo finds which queries referenced that deleted table,\nand it refetches them.Note that returning the modified objects (in this case, SeafowlSchemas that\ncontained the deleted lakes table) in the mutation response would not scale\nwell. The deleted table could have appeared in many queries, and be returned by\nvarious parents. For example, the lakes table could have been also returned by\na query that returns the latest table in the entire Seafowl instance:The deleteTable mutation result would have to contain both the updated maps\nSeafowlSchema and this latestTableInInstance top-level query. Whether to\ninclude one or the other is not known statically, because it depends on what is\nin the Apollo cache at the time of sending the mutation. Thus, letting Apollo\ndetermine the queries to refetch is perfect for mutations that delete objects.Adding new objectsMutations that add new objects are the most difficult to represent as cache\nupdates. Apollo does not know in which queries the added object could appear.\nThus, we need to determine all possible parents of the added object, identify\nthem in the cache, and invalidate the field that references the added object.To see that in practice, let's imagine we add a new mountains SeafowlTable\nusing the following mutation:Now it is our job to identify all objects that could include that mountains\ntable and tell Apollo to refetch queries that reference them. This is a hard\nproblem, because we do not know what the IDs of these parent objects could be.\nIn our example, we need to refetch:Let's try that:Doing it right requires having access to the mapsSeafowlSchema object (the\nparent of the newly-added table) so we can identify it in the cache. Depending\non the structure of the code, this may not be trivial if the component\ntriggering the mutation did not require access to the schema. For example, it\ncould have only known the names of the database (my-app) and the\nSeafowlSchema (maps) in which to create the table.To identify the parent SeafowlSchema of the added table, it may first need to\nfetch that SeafowlSchema from the API (which could be cached, in which case\nthis is almost instant, but this is not guaranteed), and only then invalidate\nit, so Apollo refetches also other queries.What about other types in the GraphQL schema that can return this new table?\nThey also need to be considered to achieve full consistency. Moreover, when the\nGraphQL schema changes, the updateCache functions need to be re-evaluated,\nsince there could be now more fields that need to be invalidated when adding a\nnew table.All of the above means that invalidating the cache after adding new objects in a\nmutation is a difficult problem to solve correctly.Caveat with invalidating fields that do not have an active queryThere is a small caveat when there is no active query that returned the\ninvalidated field. Invalidating a field will only refetch active queries\nthat reference that field.Consider the following scenario:Not refetching the queries despite data being invalidated is a problem that\nhas been reported on GitHub.\nThe workaround\ninvolves using the DELETE sentinel value instead of INVALIDATE during cache\nmutations. This way the value is field is deleted from cache and Apollo is\nforced to fetch the query, as it will not return partial data (unless\nyou tell it to).ComparisonLet's compare the presented ways of keeping Apollo cache up-to-date. We will\nassess these based on:ConclusionApollo offers many ways of keeping its cache consistent with the backend data.\nThere is no single approach that works best in every scenario. Our\nrecommendation is:for updates, include the modified data in the mutation's response. This\nrequires the least work, leads to best UX, and is easy to maintain.for deletions, mark the fields of the deleted object as invalid.When pressed for time, start by manually specifying queries to refetch, and\ngradually move towards implementing the updateCache function that\ninvalidates fields.for insertions, aim to mark the fields of parent objects as invalid. If that\nturns out to be difficult, use a manual list of queries to refetch and review\nit periodically.This amortizes the maintenance and implementation costs.All in all, cache invalidation remains a hard problem, and using Apollo is not\nan exception.Combining multiple GraphQL backends with schema stitchingProductSupportCompanyCommunitySplitgraph Inc, registered in Delaware, USASplitgraph Limited, registered in England and Wales No. 11657324Made withon four continents.	2023-06-19	{"title":"Approaches to Keeping Apollo Cache Consistent with API Data after Mutations","article":"Apollo Client is a popular GraphQL client used in React applications that simplifies communication with a GraphQL backend and improves user experience through caching. In this article, we will discuss methods for keeping the Apollo Cache up-to-date after successful data mutations.\\n\\nOne of the key features of Apollo is its normalized cache. When properly configured, it can detect situations where two different query results return parts of the same entity and merge those results into a single object in memory. This means that when there is an overlap between two queries, the result of the later query can update the values read by the earlier query if those fields have changed in the meantime.\\n\\nFor example, consider a UserComponent that updates and reads the latest age fetched by a query initiated by a different component (UserAgeComponent). Thanks to Apollo's knowledge that both queries refer to the same object in memory, updates propagate to all readers, provided the query fetch policy permits using the cache.\\n\\nIn addition to being normalized, the Apollo cache can also handle multiple different fields that refer to the same object in memory. This makes it easier to keep track of changes and maintain consistency in the cache.\\n\\nHowever, when it comes to mutations, the cache can become inconsistent with the API data. This is because mutations modify the data on the server, but the cache may still hold the old data. To keep the cache up-to-date, there are a few approaches that developers can take.\\n\\nThe first approach is to manually update the cache after a mutation. This involves writing custom update functions that modify the cache based on the mutation's response. While this approach provides more control over the cache, it can be time-consuming and error-prone.\\n\\nAnother approach is to use Apollo's built-in update functions. These functions automatically update the cache based on the mutation's response, making it easier to maintain consistency. However, they may not work for more complex mutations or custom data structures.\\n\\nFinally, developers can use a combination of both approaches. They can use Apollo's built-in update functions for simple mutations and write custom update functions for more complex ones. This approach provides the best of both worlds, allowing for greater control and flexibility.\\n\\nIn conclusion, keeping the Apollo Cache consistent with API data after mutations is crucial for maintaining data integrity and improving user experience. While there are multiple approaches to achieving this, developers should choose the one that best fits their needs and the complexity of their application. With the right approach, developers can ensure that their applications are always up-to-date and provide a seamless user experience."}
