21	Modern Image Processing Algorithms Implementation in C	https://sod.pixlab.io/articles/modern-image-processing-algorithms-implementation.html	written	reddit	["C","Image Processing Algorithm	Modern Image Processing Algorithms Overview & Implementation in CImage processing plays a crucial role in numerous fields, ranging from computer vision and medical imaging to surveillance systems and photography. The implementation of image processing algorithms in programming languages like C has become increasingly important due to the need for efficient and optimized solutions especially on embedded devices where computing power is still limited.Implementing modern image processing algorithms in C requires a solid understanding of image representation, data structures, and algorithmic concepts. Uncompressed image data are typically stored as matrices or multidimensional arrays, with each element representing a pixel's intensity or color value. C provides the necessary tools to access and manipulate individual pixels efficiently, making it ideal for algorithm implementation. Most of the algorithms featured here except the patented SIFT & SURF are already implemented in the open source, embedded, computer vision library SOD, and already in production use here at PixLab or FACEIO.More importantly, the intent of this article is to sensibilize the reader that a machine learning approach is not always the best or first solution to solve common Computer Vision problems. Standard image processing algorithms such as Skeletonization, Hough Transform, etc. when mixed and used properly, are traditionally faster than an ML based approach, yet powerful enough to solve those common computer vision challenges.Image Thinning/Skeletonization (Hilditch's Algorithm)Thinning is the operation that seeks a connected region of pixels of a given property set to a small size. Other terms commonly used are "Shrinking", or "Medial Axis Transformation"[1]. Image thinning, is a morphological operation that aims to reduce the width of the regions or objects in a binary image while preserving their connectivity and topology. The goal is to obtain a one-pixel wide representation of the objects in the image, which can be used for further processing or analysis. Image thinning is typically achieved by repeatedly applying a structuring element or a kernel to the binary image, and removing pixels that match certain conditions, such as having fewer neighbors or not being part of a continuous curve.Skeletonization on the other side is the process of transforming binary or grayscale images into a simplified representation that captures the geometric and topological properties of the objects in the input image. Skeletonization provides a simple, yet smart technique by discarding off as many pixels as possible of the target pattern while capturing its essential geometric features without affecting the general shape. That is, after application of the thinning process, the general shape of the object or pattern should still be recognizable[2]. Skeletonization is useful when we are interested not in the size of the pattern but rather in the relative position of the strokes in the pattern[8]. The aim of the skeletonization is to extract a region-based shape feature representing the general form of an object. Image thinning and skeletonization are two important techniques in image processing used to extract and represent the "skeleton" or "centerline" of an object or shape in a binary or grayscale image. They are commonly used in various applications such as computer vision, pattern recognition, medical imaging, and robotics. The skeleton of a binary object as shape descriptor has been proven to be effective for many applications fields. Popular applications of skeletonization include Optical Character Recognition, Medical Imagery, Pattern & Gesture Recognition, and so forth. The thinning process is always the first pass in modern Computer Vision applications and is heavily used here at PixLab for our Passports & ID Cards Scanning API Endpoints (Blog post announcement discussed here).One of the most widely used algorithm for Skeletonization is the Hilditch's algorithm which given an input binary image of some pattern, should produce the following output:Input Binary ImageHilditch's Algorithm OutputHilditch's algorithm is a popular algorithm for image thinning, which reduces the width of regions or objects in a binary image while preserving their connectivity and topology. It was proposed by Richard Hilditch in 1968 and is commonly used for extracting the skeleton or centerline of objects in an image. The algorithm require a binary image as its input to operate. Otherwise, the result is undefined.The basic idea of Hilditch's algorithm is to iteratively scan the binary image and remove pixels that meet certain conditions, until no more pixels can be removed. The algorithm typically operates on a binary image where the objects of interest are represented by foreground pixels (usually denoted as white) and the background is represented by background pixels (usually denoted as black).Hilditch's algorithm iteratively removes pixels from the binary image based on the predefined conditions until the objects in the image are thinned to the desired level, resulting in a one-pixel wide representation of the objects, which can be used for further analysis or processing. It's worth noting that the performance and accuracy of Hilditch's algorithm can be affected by factors such as the input image quality, object shape and size, and the choice of conditions for pixel removal, and it may require parameter tuning or modifications for specific applications.Hilditch's algorithm has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_hilditch_thin_image(). The gist below highlight a typical usage of the Hilditch's algorithm to produce the image output displayed in the section above.Both image thinning and skeletonization are used to reduce the complexity of an object or shape in an image while preserving its essential characteristics. They can help in extracting useful features, such as the shape, orientation, and connectivity of objects, and can be used as a pre-processing step for various image analysis tasks such as content filtering. However, it's important to note that the choice of the thinning or skeletonization algorithm, as well as the input image quality and characteristics, can greatly affect the results and accuracy of these techniques.Image SegmentationImage segmentation is an umbrella term that includes a set of techniques for image processing based on applying a dividing strategy (i.e. a single image is divided in multiple parts)[5]. After the dividing process, each one of the image components is used for a specific purpose, for example, to identify objects or other relevant information. Several methods are used for image segmentation: Thresholding, Color-based, Texture Filters, Clustering, among others. An effective approach to performing image segmentation includes using existing algorithms and tools, and integrating specific components for data analysis, image visualization, and the development and implementation of specific algorithms[5]. The goal of image segmentation is to partition an image into semantically meaningful regions that can be further analyzed, processed, or understood by a computer.Image segmentation has numerous applications in fields such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, image editing, object & face recognition where it is heavily used on FACEIO, our facial authentication web framework (Blog launch announcement here). Image segmentation provides a foundation for higher-level image analysis tasks, such as object detection, object tracking, and image understanding, as it can facilitate the extraction of relevant information from images at a more granular level.There are various methods for image segmentation, ranging from traditional to more advanced techniques, including:One of the most popular approaches for image segmentation is through thresholding. Thresholding takes a grayscale image and replaces each pixel with a black one if its intensity is less than some fixed constant, or a white pixel if the intensity is greater than that constant. The new binary image produced separates dark from bright regions. Mainly because finding pixels that share intensity in a region is not computationally expensive, thresholding is a simple and efficient method for image segmentation[5].Several approaches have been proposed to define thresholding methods. According to the categorization defined by Sezgin and Sankur[7], six strategies were identified[5]:Histogram Shape Methods, which uses information from the image histogram.Clustering Methods, which groups objects in classes, i.e. Background or Foreground.Entropy Methods, which make use of entropy information for foreground and background, or cross-entropy between the original and the binary image.Object Attribute Methods, which evaluate and use the similarities between the original and the binary image.Spatial Methods, which apply higher-order probability distribution and/or correlation between pixels.Local Methods, based on adapting the threshold value to locally defined characteristics.Various thresholding & edge detection techniques are widely available and implemented in SOD via sod_binarize_image(), sod_threshold_image(), sod_canny_edge_image(), sod_sobel_image(), etc.Input (Grayscale colorspace) ImageFixed Thresholding OutputThe gist below showcase how to obtain a binary image via fixed thresholding to produce the image output displayed above.Otsu's MethodPut it simply, Otsu's method (named after Nobuyuki Otsu) is a popular thresholding algorithm for image segmentation, belonging to the clustering category, and is usually used for thresholding and binarization. Thresholding is used to extract an object from its background by assigning an intensity value T (threshold) for each pixel such that each pixel is either classified as foreground or background point.Otsu's method is a simple yet effective method for image thresholding, as it automatically determines the threshold value without requiring any user-defined parameter. It has been widely used in various image processing applications, such as image segmentation, object detection, and image analysis. However, it may not be suitable for all images or scenarios, as it assumes that the foreground and background classes have distinct intensity or color values, and may not perform well in cases where this assumption is not metInput ImageOtsu's Algorithm OutputOtsu's method works mainly with the image histogram, looking at the pixel values and the regions that the user wants to segment out, rather than looking at the edges of an image. It tries to segment the image making the variance on each of the classes minimal. The algorithm works well for images that contain two classes of pixels, following a bi-modal histogram distribution. The algorithm divides the image histogram into two classes, by using a threshold such as the in-class variability is very small. This way, each class will be as compact as possible. The spatial relationship between pixels is not taken into account, so regions that have similar pixel values but are in completely different locations in the image will be merged when computing the histogram, meaning that Otsu’s algorithm treats them as the same[5]. The algorithm works as follows:Otsu's method has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_otsu_binarize_image(). The gist below highlight a typical usage of the Otsu's algorithm to produce the image output displayed above.Minutiae Features ExtractionMinutiae features extraction is a common technique used in fingerprint recognition, which is a widely used biometric authentication method in computer vision. Fingerprint recognition is based on the unique and distinct ridge patterns and characteristics present in fingerprints, which are used to identify individuals.Fingerprints are the oldest and most widely used form of biometric identification. Everyone is known to have mostly unique, immutable fingerprints. As most Automatic Fingerprint Recognition Systems are based on local ridge features known as minutiae, marking minutiae accurately and rejecting false ones is very important. However, fingerprint images get degraded and corrupted due to variations in skin and impression conditions. Thus, image enhancement techniques such as Hilditch Thinning, Thresholding, etc. are employed prior to minutiae extraction. A critical step in automatic fingerprint matching is to reliably extract minutiae from the input fingerprint image[6].Fingerprints are the most widely used parameter for personal identification amongst all biometrics. Fingerprint identification is commonly employed in forensic science to aid criminal investigations etc. A fingerprint is a unique pattern of ridges and valleys on the surface of a finger of an individual. A ridge is defined as a single curved segment, and a valley is the region between two adjacent ridges. Minutiae points (img.2) are the local ridge discontinuities, which are of two types: ridge endings and bifurcations. A good quality image has around 40 to 100 minutiae[6]. It is these minutiae points which are used for determining uniqueness of a fingerprint.Input Grayscaled Fingerprintsod_minutiae() OutputMinutiae are the ridge and valley characteristics or details found in fingerprints, such as ridge endings, ridge bifurcations, and short ridges. Ridge endings are points where ridges terminate, while ridge bifurcations are points where ridges split into two branches. Short ridges are small ridge segments that connect two longer ridges.Minutiae features extraction has been successfully deployed in SOD via the exported function sod_minutiae(). The gist below extracts ridges and bifurcations from a fingerprint image using sod_minutiae().Hough TransformThe Hough transform is a popular image processing technique used for detecting lines or other parametric shapes in images. It was developed by Paul Hough in 1962 and has since been widely used in computer vision and image analysis applications. Hough transform works by converting image points from the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y) to a parameter space, known as the Hough space, which is represented by a different set of coordinates, typically denoted as (θ, ρ), where θ represents the angle of the line and ρ represents the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line along the line's normal vector.Hough transform is a robust technique for detecting lines in images, even in the presence of noise or partial occlusion. It is widely used in various image processing and computer vision applications, such as shape recognition, document scanning, and traffic sign recognition.Input Binary ImageHough Lines Detection OutputHough transform can be used for detecting lines in an input image or video frame using the following steps:Hough transform have been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_hough_lines_detect(). The gist below highlight a typical usage on how to extract straight lines on a given input image or video frame.Canny Edge DetectionCanny edge is a popular image processing algorithm used for detecting edges in a given image while suppressing noise. It is very popular among computer vision systems, and was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. A typical output of a canny edged image is shown below:Input ImageCanny Edge OutputThe main steps for outputting a canny edged image are:Canny edge has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_canny_edge_image(). The result of the Canny edge detection algorithm is a binary image where the strong edge pixels form continuous curves representing the detected edges. These edges correspond to the significant changes in intensity or color in the original image. The gist below highlight a typical invocation of the canny edge detection algorithm to produce the image output displayed in the section above.Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) AlgorithmThe scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm is a widely used, patented method for extracting distinctive and robust features from images. It was proposed by David Lowe in 1999 and has become a fundamental technique in image processing, computer vision, and object recognition tasks. The SIFT algorithm is particularly effective in handling changes in scale, rotation, affine transformations, and partial occlusions.SIFT, extracts a set of descriptors from an image[10]. The extracted descriptors are invariant to image translation, rotation and scaling (zoom-out). SIFT descriptors have also proved to be robust to a wide family of image transformations, such as slight changes of viewpoint, noise, blur, contrast changes, scene deformation, while remaining discriminating enough for matching purposes.Original SIFT algorithm flow [14]SIFT consists of two successive and independent operations: The detection of interesting points (i.e. keypoints) and the extraction of a descriptor associated to each of them. Since these descriptors are robust, they are usually used for matching pairs of images. Object recognition and video stabilization are other popular application examples.SIFT detects a series of keypoints from a multiscale image representation. That is, it locates certain key points and then furnishes them with quantitative information (so-called descriptors)[12]. This multiscale representation consists of a family of increasingly blurred images. Each keypoint is a blob-like structure whose center position (x, y) and characteristic scale σ are accurately located. SIFT computes the dominant orientation θ over a region surrounding each one of these keypoints. For each keypoint, the quadruple (x, y, σ, θ) defines the center, size and orientation of a normalized patch where the SIFT descriptor is computed. As a result of this normalization, SIFT keypoint descriptors are in theory invariant to any translation, rotation and scale change. The descriptor encodes the spatial gradient distribution around a keypoint by a 128-dimensional vector. This feature vector is generally used to match keypoints extracted from different images.The figure above, shows a flow diagram of the original SIFT algorithm. Hierarchical algorithm is adopted to obtain robustness to a scale change. The SIFT descriptor generation consists of Gaussian filtering, key-point extraction and descriptor vector generation. The input image is smoothed by Gaussian filtering for key-point extraction. Adjacent Gaussian filtered images are subtracted for difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) generation. Key-point is detected by searching on DOG. Key-point detection uses three DOG images. Maxima and minima of DOG images are detected by comparing a pixel in middle scale to its 26 neighbors in 3×3 regions at the current and adjacent scales. Finally, SIFT descriptor vectors are obtained by calculating a gradient histogram of luminance around the key-point. The whole process can be divided into several key steps as outlined below:Finally, an open source C implementation of the SIFT algorithm, can be found at https://github.com/robwhess/opensift.Sobel OperatorThe Sobel operator is a widely used edge detection operator in image processing. It is a simple and computationally efficient filter that is commonly used to detect edges or boundaries between regions of different intensities in an image. The Sobel operator is typically applied to grayscale images, but it can also be used on color images by applying it separately to each color channel.The Sobel operator works by convolving a small filter or kernel with the input image. The filter is a small matrix typically of size 3x3 or 5x5, and it consists of two separate kernels, one for detecting vertical edges and one for detecting horizontal edges. These two kernels are often referred to as the Sobel operators or Sobel kernels.To apply the Sobel operator to an input image, the operator is convolved with the image by placing the kernel at each pixel location and performing element-wise multiplication and summation. The result is a new image, often referred to as the gradient image or edge map, which represents the strength and direction of edges in the original image.The vertical Sobel operator highlights edges that run vertically in the image, such as edges that represent changes in intensity from top to bottom. The horizontal Sobel operator highlights edges that run horizontally in the image, such as edges that represent changes in intensity from left to right. By applying both vertical and horizontal Sobel operators, the Sobel operator can detect edges in multiple orientations.The Sobel operator is commonly used in various image processing tasks, such as image segmentation, object detection, and feature extraction. It is a popular choice for edge detection due to its simplicity and effectiveness in highlighting edges in images.Input Grayscaled ImageSobel Operator OutputThe Sobel operator has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_sobel_image(). The gist below highlight a typical invocation of the Sobel operator to produce the image output displayed in the section above.Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) AlgorithmSpeeded Up Robust Features or SURF for short is a patented algorithm used mostly in computer vision applications. SURF fall in the category of feature descriptors by extracting keypoints from different regions of a given image and thus is very useful in finding similarity between images. It was introduced by Herbert Bay et al. in 2006 as an efficient and robust alternative to the SIFT algorithm. SURF features are designed to be invariant to scale, rotation, and changes in viewpoint, making them suitable for various image analysis tasks.SURF Keypoints detection [11]SURF locates features using an approximation to the determinant of the Hessian, chosen for its stability and repeatability, as well as its speed. An ideal filter would construct the Hessian by convolving the second-order derivatives of a Gaussian of a given scale σ with the input image. The SURF algorithm operates as follow:Finally, SURF is advertised to perform faster compared to previously proposed schemes like SIFT. This is achieved (as stated by its designers) by:BLOB DetectionBlob detection is a commonly used technique in image processing and computer vision for detecting regions or regions of interest (ROIs) in an image that have similar properties, such as intensity, color, or texture. Blobs are typically characterized by their intensity or color properties, and they can represent objects, features, or structures of interest in an image.Input Binary ImageIsolated Blob RegionsBlob detection algorithms typically operate on grayscale or color images and involve the following steps:A general purpose blob detector has been successfully implemented in SOD via the exported function sod_image_find_blobs(). The gist below highlight a typical usage of the built-in blob detector to isolate potential regions of interest for an OCR system for example.Blob detection is widely used in various image processing and computer vision applications, such as document scanning, Face Anti-Spoofing, image analysis, and medical imaging. It is a versatile technique that can be adapted to different types of images and properties of interest, making it a powerful tool for many computer vision tasks.ConclusionIn conclusion, the implementation of modern image processing algorithms in C offers a powerful and efficient approach for handling complex image analysis tasks. C's low-level nature and control over memory management provide opportunities for optimizing computational performance. With a solid understanding of image representation, data structures, and algorithmic concepts, developers can harness the potential of C to create robust and efficient solutions for image processing applications.References Porting a Face Detector Written in C to WebAssemblyList of Publication Home Getting Started API Downloads License Support	2023-06-06	{"title":"\\"Modern Image Processing Algorithms Implementation in C: A Guide for Developers\\"","article":"\\nThis article was originally published on the PixLab blog.\\n\\nImage processing is a critical component of many industries, from medical imaging to photography.

Just go to File > Add to Dock, adjust the name and icon if desired, and the web app icon appears in your Dock.\nWeb apps on Mac let you focus on the websites you use all the time, separate from the rest of your browsing. Like all Mac apps, web apps work great with Stage Manager, Mission Control, and keyboard shortcuts like Command + Tab. Web apps can be opened from the Dock, Launchpad, and Spotlight Search. Web apps work with AutoFill credentials from iCloud Keychain and from third-party apps that have adopted the Credential Provider Extension API. And users can grant permission to a web app to use their camera, microphone and location in the same way they grant such permissions to other Mac apps through system prompts and the Privacy & Security section of System Settings. Web apps on Mac support web push, badging, and all the usual web standards implemented by WebKit, just like web apps on iOS and iPadOS.\nWhen a user clicks on a web app icon, the website always opens in its own window as a web app, even if the site does not have a manifest file (or legacy meta tags). This expands the usefulness of web apps, putting users in charge of determining what becomes a web app and giving them the confidence it’s always something they can choose.\nWhile the default web app experience on Mac is great, as a web app developer you can use web technologies like Service Workers to make it even better. By providing a web app manifest, you can customize the presentation of your web app, including the display mode, name, theme color, and start URL. Learn about the details by watching What’s new in Web Apps at WWDC23.\nWhen a user adds a website to their Dock, Safari will copy the website’s cookies to the web app. That way, if someone is logged into their account in Safari, they will remain logged in within the web app. This will only work if the authentication state is stored within cookies. Safari does not copy over any other kind of local storage. After a user adds a web app to the Dock, no other website data is shared, which is great for privacy.\nAdd to Home Screen from Safari View Controller\nAdd to Home Screen is now available from Safari View Controller on iOS and iPadOS. Tapping a link within an app that uses Safari View Controller as the in-app browser allows the user to add the open website to their Home Screen right from there. Just like Add to Home Screen from Safari on iOS and iPadOS (or any other browser that implemented support), if the website has a manifest file with a display mode of standalone or fullscreen, it will open as a Home Screen web app.\nSpatial Web\nWe can’t wait for you to try out Safari on Vision Pro. This truly is Safari, with the same WebKit engine — plus a few additions. All of your websites will work beautifully out of the box, thanks to its extensive support for web standards. You can see exactly how Safari on Vision Pro works by watching the WWDC23 Keynote and Meet Safari for spatial computing.\nWe are collaborating on two technologies to make the web in spatial computing even more powerful — the <model> element and WebXR.\nModel\nThe <model> element will provide a way to easily present 3D content in a web page without any scripting. Just like with <img> and <video>, HTML makes it possible for <model> to work in a robust and simple manner across web browsers on any platform. Model is still undergoing standardization and is subject to change, but we expect it will work like this:\n<model src="asset/example-3d-model" width="400" height="300"></model>\nBy creating a declarative element, we can leverage well-known patterns for supporting multiple file formats, while simultaneously providing fallbacks for browsers without support.\n<model width="400" height="300" interactive> <source src="assets/example.usdz" type="model/vnd.usdz+zip"> <source src="assets/example.glb" type="model/gltf-binary"> <picture> <source src="fallback-version.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <source src="fallback-version.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="fallback-version.gif"/> </picture>\n</model>\nThe interactive attribute will enable user interaction and allow people to rotate the model in place. An accompanying JavaScript API will provide even more capabilities, including access to the camera. The exact details of how <model> will work are currently being debated at the Immersive Web Community Group.\nThe ability to embed rich 3D content into a web page will open up a world of possibilities. For example, an online shoe store might provide models of all their shoes. Or a website for interior design inspiration could provide furniture models for people to “place” virtually in their homes. Safari on Vision Pro will take such experiences to the next level, with a full stereoscopic view and environmental lighting — all in a privacy-preserving way. What or where the user is looking is never exposed to the web page.\nYou can try out <model> in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS by turning on its feature flag and navigating to this demo page.\nWebXR\nWhen embedding a 3D model into a web page isn’t enough, WebXR provides the technology for creating a fully immersive experience on the web. WebXR is based on WebGL, and many popular WebGL libraries already have built in support.\nSafari on Vision Pro currently has testable support for WebXR, available behind a feature flag while we collaborate with the W3C Immersive Web Working Group on updates to the web standard. WebKit supports the immersive-vr session type in WebXR. Vision Pro does not have external controllers. Instead, you can request the “hand-tracking” feature to let users interact with your content.\nVisit the Immersive Web Working Group developer page at immersiveweb.dev to learn more about getting started with different frameworks that include WebXR support and to find one that best fits your project.\nImages\nJPEG XL\nWe are pleased to announce that support for JPEG XL is coming to Safari 17. Similar to JPEG, the new image format provides another modern option for finding the right balance between quality and file size. JPEG XL uses a new compression algorithm called “Modular Entropy Coding” that allows for greater flexibility in adjusting the compression ratio. With support for progressive loading, it’s well suited for images served over slow connections, since users start to see the image before the whole file is downloaded. And you can recompress existing JPEG files into JPEG XL without any loss of data, while reducing their size by an average of 20%. Or compress from the original image file to create a file that’s up to 60% smaller compared to JPEG!\nUse the <picture> element to provide JPEG XL files to browsers that have support, while providing a fallback for browsers that don’t.\n<picture> <source srcset="images/large/sophie.jxl" type="image/jxl"> <img src="images/large/sophie.jpeg">\n</picture>\nJPEG XL will be supported by WebKit for Safari 17, Safari View Controller and WKWebView on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, as well as iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS.\nHEIC\nWe are also adding support for HEIC images to Safari 17, which uses the HEVC video codec compression algorithm. HEIC is the file format used on iPhone and iPad to store photos taken with the camera. With support for HEIC in Safari, Safari View Controller, and WKWebView, developers can support importing and editing such photos right in the browser, without needing to convert them into another format. HEIC is also ideal for displaying images when using WKWebView inside an app.\nImage set\nSafari 17 also improves our implementation of image-set(), increasing interoperability with other browsers as part of our commitment to Interop 2023 , and adding support for the optional resolution and type arguments. The type argument provides you with a means to offer browsers multiple image formats to choose from, including JPEG XL and HEIC.\n.component { background-image: image-set( url("images/trees.jxl") type("image/jxl"), url("images/trees.avif") type("image/avif"), url("images/trees.jpeg") type("image/jpeg") );\n}\nVideo\nManaged Media Source\nWebKit for Safari 17 also brings the new Managed Media Source API. It provides a power-efficient solution fulfilling advanced needs as a low-level toolkit for streaming video.\nAdaptive bitrate streaming allows for switching between media data formats — ensuring delivery of the best possible video quality based on the user’s internet connection speed and device capabilities, even as those conditions change. Media Source Extensions (MSE) is an existing low-level toolkit for adaptive streaming giving the web page more control and responsibilities for managing buffering and resolution. But MSE isn’t particularly good at managing buffer levels, network access, and media variant selection. And it uses a lot of power on mobile devices.\nManaged Media Source adds the capabilities of MSE, without any of the drawbacks. It’s available on iPadOS 17 beta and macOS Sonoma beta, and is in preview on iOS 17 beta, where it can be tested by turning on its feature flag. Note that Managed Media Source is only made available when an AirPlay source alternative is present.\nLearn more about JPEG XL, HEIC, and Managed Media Source API by watching Explore media formats for the web at WWDC23.\nMedia player stats overlay\nIf you’ve enabled Developer Features, WebKit now provides a media player stats overlay where you can see technical details about a video — its source type, size, performance metrics, resolution, codec string, and color configuration. To show the overlay, use the context menu on any <video> element and select “Show Media Stats”. Now you can tell at a glance the exact codec and configuration used by media on your page and use that information to craft accurate queries in MediaCapabilities.\nAnd more video\nWebKit now supports USB cameras on iPadOS 17. When a USB camera is attached to an iPad, it’s included in the output of enumerateDevices() and is selectable with getUserMedia() along with the built-in cameras.\nImprovements to WebRTC add support for InputDeviceInfo, the inbound rtp trackIdentifier stat field, exposing zoom in MediaTrackCapabilities, and getDisplayMedia video track clone resizing.\nWebKit for Safari 17 adds additional support for low-power mode — optimizing video streaming by tone mapping HDR video to SDR.\nHTML\nPopover\nSafari 17 adds support for the popover attribute. It provides a framework for displaying overlays, popups, popovers, and dialogs. There are two types of popovers, which can be used as values for the popover attribute:\nauto popovers, which automatically close when you click outside of the popover; and\nmanual popovers, which don’t have this automatic closing behavior.\nUse a button (either a <button> element or button input type) to create the UI for opening and closing the popover. And add the appropriate HTML attributes to create the desired result.\nThe popovertarget attribute connects the button to the popover content through an ID. The optional popovertargetaction attribute takes show, hide, or toggle as values. By default, toggle is used.\n<button popovertarget="info-box" popovertargetaction="show">More info</button>\n<article id="info-box" popover="auto"> <h2>Additional Information</h2> <p>Here’s something I wanted to tell you.</p> <button popovertarget="info-box" popovertargetaction="hide">Close</button>\n</article>\nThis is just one UI pattern you might find useful. There are many possible combinations. Having a popover mechanism in HTML makes for quick work, while ensuring great usability and full accessibility.\nTo go beyond a simple button trigger, a JavaScript API opens up more powerful possibilities through showPopover(), hidePopover(), and togglePopover().\nAnd more HTML\nSafari 17 on macOS adds support for <hr> inside of <select>, which is a feature the WebKit team added to the HTML Standard. This makes it easier to create a visual separator between items without requiring the use of JavaScript.\n<select> <option value="pizza">Pizza</option> <option value="hamburger">Hamburger</option> <hr> <option value="sushi">Ice cream</option> <option value="pasta">Cake</option>\n</select>\nThe <menu> element is now mapped to role=list. Slotted elements are now announced when inside <dialog> or aria-modal. And now slot elements referenced with aria-labelledby are properly labeled.\nCSS\nCounter styles\nSafari 17 adds support for CSS Counter Styles, providing a mechanism through @counter-style for changing a counter’s language or character set in CSS — both for ordered/unordered lists with list-style-type, and for CSS Counters.\n@counter-style upper-serbian { system: alphabetic; symbols: 'А' 'Б' 'В' 'Г' 'Д' 'Ђ' 'Е' 'Ж' 'З' 'И' 'Ј' 'К' 'Л' 'Љ' 'М' 'Н' 'Њ' 'О' 'П' 'Р' 'С' 'Т' 'Ћ' 'У' 'Ф' 'Х' 'Ц' 'Ч' 'Џ' 'Ш';\n}\nol { list-style: upper-serbian; }\nFont size adjust\nIn Safari 16.4, we shipped initial support for font-size-adjust, which allows you to easily make the visual size of different fonts consistent — even across all possible combinations of fallback fonts. The basic version of font-size-adjust lets you tell the browser to resize letters so that their x-height is a specific ratio of the font-size.\nIn Safari 17, we’re expanding support to include more advance capabilities of font-size-adjust, including the from-font value and two-value syntax. Instead of declaring a ratio with a number value, the from-font value allows you to ask the browser to pull the sizing metric from the main font being specified, and apply that ratio to all fonts. Two-value syntax lets you switch from adjusting ex-height to adjusting cap-height, ch-width, ic-width, or ic-height — providing support for a broader range of languages and design choices.\nLet’s look at an example. Here, font-size-adjust tells the browser to make all of the fonts inside article match the size of the x-height of the main font being used. This means all of the text in paragraphs and code will visually appear to be the same size, no matter which font is applied from either stack, or how different the paragraph and code fonts appear in actual size.\narticle { font-family: "Iowan Old Style", "Palatino Linotype", "URW Palladio L", P052, serif; font-size: 1.4rem; font-size-adjust: from-font;\n}\narticle code { font-family: "Courier New", monospace;\n}\nTo learn much more about how font-size-adjust works, as well as all about Counter Styles, watch What’s new in CSS at WWDC23.\nSafari 17 also brings support for @font-face size-adjust, which provides a way for you to normalize visual size when defining a font’s use.\nText transform\nSafari 17 adds support for text-transform: full-width and full-size-kana, and adds support for multiple text-transform values. The full-width value transforms all the characters in a string of text to be “full-width” — to match the size of characters in an East Asian script like those for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. It’s especially useful when wanting to improve consistency in sizing when typesetting CJK. The full-size-kana value transforms the size of Kana characters in Japanese to be full-size, rather than the typical small size — useful to make ruby text more legible when needed.\nFont support\nTo expand what’s possible with web typography, Safari 17 adds two feature queries for writing CSS depending on the presence or absence of browser support for font tech or format: @supports font-tech() as well as @supports font-format(). Font tech refers to specific kinds of OpenType technology used in some fonts, like COLRv0. Safari 17 also adds support for @font-face { src: url() tech() }, making it easy to define the use of a font that depends on newer tech, while providing a fallback for browsers without support.\n@font-face { font-family: "My Cool Font"; src: url("mycoolfont-COLRv0.otf") format(opentype) tech(color-COLRv0), url("mycoolfont-outline.otf") format(opentype);\n}\nMedia Queries 4\nSafari 17 rounds out support for Media Queries level 4, with support for two new media queries. Like the others, overflow-block and overflow-inline provide a way to conditionally apply CSS depending on the qualities of a user’s device — in this case, how the device handles overflow. For example, can it scroll the page like a typical browser on a computer? Does it page the content, like an e-book reader? Or does it have no mechanism for handling overflow, like a digital billboard?\nAnd more CSS\nWebKit for Safari 17 includes multiple fixes to improve accessibility of display: contents, including making aria-activedescendant, aria-dropeffect, aria-flowto, aria-grabbed, aria-owns, AXAccessKey, CSS speak-as, and URL AX APIs work on elements that have display: contents applied. As well as computing the accessible name for display: contents elements that rely on labels or captions, and making display: contents elements to be able to return selected accessibility children.\nSafari 17 also adds support for contain-intrinsic-size, providing a way to set the size of an element to use for layout when the element is subject to size containment.\nTo increase the usefulness of :has(), WebKit now supports :has(:buffering) and :has(:stalled) to expand the ability to apply CSS conditionally based on the state of media playback. And Safari 17 supports :has(:defined) for applying styling based on the presence of a custom element that has been defined.\nTo keep up with the most recent changes to the web standard for Container Queries, Safari 17 adds support for containerName and containerQuery, and updates conditionText to be containerName containerQuery in CSSContainerRule.\nJavaScript and Web API\nOffscreen Canvas\nWhen using Canvas, the rendering, animation, and user interaction usually happens on the main execution thread of a web application. Offscreen Canvas provides a canvas that can be rendered off-screen, decoupling the DOM and the Canvas API so that the <canvas> element is no longer entirely dependent on the DOM. Rendering can be transferred to a worker context, allowing you to run tasks in a separate thread and avoid heavy work on the main thread that can negatively impact the user experience. The combination of DOM-independent operations and rendering of the main thread can provide a significantly better experience for users, especially on low-power devices. Support for Offscreen Canvas 2D operations shipped in Safari 16.4. Now, Safari 17 adds support for 3D contexts in Offscreen Canvas.\nStorage\nWebKit has made some big updates to the storage quota policy. Previously, an origin had a starting storage limit of 1 GB. When exceeding the limit, the subsequent storage operation would fail in Home Screen web apps, or the user would see a prompt asking to increase the quota for the origin in Safari. Starting in macOS Sonoma, iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, the quota is calculated based on total disk space without the user’s input. The origin generally gets a much higher limit, and the user isn’t prompted in Safari. To get the estimated value of the current origin quota and usage, you can use the newly supported navigator.storage.estimate() method.\nAs each origin gets a higher storage limit by default, WebKit will evict data by origin when the total usage of all origins is bigger than a certain value, the “overall quota”, calculated based on total disk space. An origin is exempt from eviction when its storage mode is persistent. To check the storage mode of your origin, you can use navigator.storage.persisted(); to request the mode be changed to persistent, you can use navigator.storage.persist(). Critical bug fixes have been made to ensure the storage mode value is remembered across sessions, and eviction will count on it. The Storage API is now fully supported.\nRegEx\nSafari 17 adds JavaScript support for two new Regular Expression features, RegExp v flag with set notation + properties of strings and RegExp duplicate named capture groups. The RegExp v flag feature allows for the creation of regular expressions containing Unicode properties, including some multi-character Emoji sequences. It also allows for creating regular expressions with union, intersection, and subtraction set operations on character classes and collections of strings.\nThe Duplicate Named Capture Group feature enables the creation of regular expressions with named captures where more than one capture group uses the same name. This allows you to create regular expressions with intuitive group names where there is more than a one-way pattern to search. An example is creating one regular expression that can search data strings written in multiple ways, e.g. M/D/Y versus D-M-Y, while extracting the matched results with captured group names month, day, and year regardless of which string format was matched.\nSet Operations\nAnother new JavaScript feature adds several new Set operation methods, including intersection() and union() as well as comparison methods including difference(), isSubsetOf() and isSuperSetOf(). Together these new methods make Sets first class objects.\nconst setA = new Set(["apples", "oranges", "grapes"]);\nconst setB = new Set(["bananas", "grapes", "apples"]);\n// Union into single set!\nconst union = setA.union(setB);\n// Interection "apples" and "grapes"\nconst intersect = setA.intersection(setB);\n// Difference "oranges"\nconst diff = setA.difference(setB);\nAnd so on. Check out also the new .symmetricDifference() and .isDisjointFrom() methods, which open some interesting comparison possibilities.\nGamepad API\nWebKit for Safari 17 adds support for Gamepad.prototype.vibrationActuator. It enables “dual-rumble” haptic feedback on gamepads. The API allows you to check if “dual-rumble” is supported by the gamepad, as well as control the duration and magnitude of the haptic effect.\nconst [gamepad] = navigator.getGamepads();\nif (gamepad?.vibrationActuator?.canPlayEffectType("dual-rumble")) { const options = { duration: 1000, // 1 seconds startDelay: 0, // play now strongMagnitude: 0.5, // low-frequency vibration weakMagnitude: 0.2, // high-frequency vibration }; gamepad.vibrationActuator.playEffect("dual-rumble", options);\n}\nURL API\nTraditionally, to ensure you could parse a URL, you needed to use a try sequence. Now, you can directly detect if an URL input can be parsed with URL.canParse(tentativeURL, optionalBase). The method will return true or false.\nIn addition, the has() and delete() methods on URLSearchParams have been extended. The has() method makes it possible to detect if a parameter has been set. And the delete() method can delete a parameter. Until now, you could only check for, and delete, by name alone. Now, the methods have been extended so that you can check for, and delete, specific name-value pairs.\nFor example, the following URL has currency as a duplicate key: https://example.com/?currency=USD&currency=JPY, before you could only check params.has('currency'). It is now possible to do: params.has('currency', 'JPY').\nBe mindful that with this update, method signatures are not directly feature detectable, so they can return false positives. Until all browsers support these updates, be sure to run a small test to confirm support. For example:\n// These return true only when the updated API is supported!\nfunction supportsUpdatedURLHasMethod() { const param = new URLSearchParams({ key: "value" }); return param.has("key", "does not exist") === false;\n}\nfunction supportsUpdatedURLDeleteMethod() { const param = new URLSearchParams({ key: "value" }); param.delete("key", "does not exist"); return param.has("key");\n}\nWeb Sockets\nYou can now use relative URLs (as well as HTTP(S) URLs) in the WebSocket constructor — this makes it a lot easier to point to WebSocket endpoints without hard-coding URLs into your web application. For example, new WebSocket('/updates').\nAnd more JavaScript and Web API\nSupport for <link rel="modulepreload">. Support for the focus fixup rule. Support for Ed25519 cryptography. Support for pausing and resuming background fetches. Support for ReadableStream. Support for fetch priority hints. Support for customElements.getName method.\nWeb Developer Tools\nRedesigned Develop Menu\nIn Safari 17 on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, a completely redesigned Develop menu makes it easier to find the key tools available to help you create websites, web apps, web content inside other apps, web extensions, and more.\nDevices and simulators are now more prominent in the Develop menu, making them easier to identify at a glance. Inside the menu for each iOS or iPadOS device, app icons make it easier to find the application or web content you want to inspect. On macOS Sonoma you can pair with Apple TV and Vision Pro directly from Safari to inspect those platforms.\nRethought Feature Flags\nThe new Feature Flags panel replaces the previous Experimental Features section of the Develop menu, allowing you to search for specific features and to easily see bolded features toggled from their default state. Feature flags are now organized by topic: Animation, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Media and more. And each feature is clearly categorized into one of four statuses: Stable, Testable, Preview, and Developer.\nStable represents features that have recently shipped in Safari, on by default. These features can be turned off to help you debug an issue or test progressive enhancements. Stable features will eventually be removed from the list.\nTestable features are disabled by default. These features might be in the process of being implemented, or they might be waiting for changes to the web standards. They have a ways to go, but still could be interesting enough to test out.\nPreview is for features that have not yet shipped in Safari, but are closer to being complete. These features are on by default in Safari Technology Preview, and are ready for developers to try out. They may still have bugs, or may even undergo significant change as web standards evolve. This is a great time to help find and file bugs, and to comment on whether the web standard for a new technologies solves your needs.\nDeveloper features are not as common. This category is for miscellaneous features added to the list of feature flags so developers can toggle them on and off for testing. Developer tools may appear here, for example.\nNew Developer settings panel\nThe new Developer panel in Safari 17’s Settings let you toggle developer features that apply across all websites open in Safari, like Allow remote automation (which enables automating Safari with WebDriver) and other features that were previously in the Develop menu.\nNew tab-specific setting overlay\nSome previously-global settings from the Develop menu, like disabling CSS or changing WebRTC behavior, have moved to Web Inspector where they are now scoped to the inspected tab, allowing you to use other tabs and windows normally.\nRedesigned Responsive Web Design Mode\nResponsive Design Mode has also been refreshed to focus on the responsiveness of a page’s design at any width or height on your Mac. You can type in a specific viewport size at the top of Responsive Design Mode in addition to dragging the resize handles around the view.\nAlso new is the ability to open the page in a Simulator right from Responsive Design Mode.\nSimulators\nYou can also open any page from Safari in a Simulator directly from the Develop > Open Page With menu, even when you are not using Responsive Design Mode.\nUsing a Simulator is a great way to test the experiences you’re making on iOS, iPadOS, and coming soon, visionOS — including device-specific behaviors, like the rendered size of type, the effects of the viewport meta tag, double-tap to zoom, and even Home Screen web apps on iOS and iPadOS. Simulators are free, and come included with Xcode from the Mac App Store.\nIf you don’t have Xcode installed, a link to documentation is conveniently available in the Develop > Open Page With menu, as well as the Open with Simulator menu in Responsive Design Mode, to help you get started, or to add more devices and OS versions.\nLearn all about the new Develop menu, redesigned Responsive Web Design mode, how to easily connect to directly to a real device, how to install and use a Simulator, and much more in Rediscover Safari developer features at WWDC23.\nWeb Inspector\nWe’ve also made improvements to Web Inspector. When working with minified sources, pretty printing in Web Inspector can help make the code easier to read, set breakpoints in, and debug. New in Safari 17, more JavaScript syntax is supported for pretty printing minified scripts, including template strings, optional chaining, private variables and functions in classes, and static variables and functions.\nChanges to Web Inspector in Safari 17 also include:\nElements tab: Added settings to always show rulers and element overlays for grid and flexbox when highlighting elements in Web Inspector or in Element Selection Mode.\nElements tab: Added editing controls for variation axes in the Fonts sidebar.\nConsole tab: Added setting to show timestamps for console messages.\nConsole tab: Added support for viewing the target of a WeakRef.\nSources tab: Added support for ES2022 Private Fields when inspecting and logging JavaScript objects.\nGraphics tab: Added support for OffscreenCanvas.\nLearn more by watching What’s new in Web Inspector at WWDC23.\nSecurity\nGPU Process\nLast year brought GPU process support to WebKit on iOS, iPadOS and watchOS. This year we’re adding support on macOS Sonoma. The change moves all drawing (including the drawing of page content, 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering) so it occurs in the “GPU Process”. This new architecture allows WebKit to isolate powerful graphics hardware and driver access away from the WebContent process, which is the process that interacts with untrusted content from the Internet. The new design also allows the WebContent process sandbox to completely block IOKit access, resulting in improved security.\nWebGL\nImprovements to WebGL include adding support for WEBGL_clip_cull_distance, EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2, EXT_polygon_offset_clamp and GPUExternalTexture.\nWebKit API\nNew interfaces are added to WKWebsiteDataStore and related classes to further unlock the potential of your WebKit apps. The new capabilities include creating persistent website data stores, configuring cookie policy, customizing proxy settings, requesting HTTPS upgrade for all navigations, and controlling state of inline prediction for autocomplete.\nBrowser changes\nSafari Profiles\nSafari 17 adds support for profiles. History, favorites, Tab Groups and website data such as cookies, caches, service workers, and Web Push subscriptions are scoped per-profile. Users can manage each profile’s data individually.\nSafari Private Browsing\nIn Safari 17, Private Browsing gets even more private with added protection against some of the most advanced techniques used to track you. Technical changes include:\nAdding blocking for known trackers and fingerprinting. Adding support for mitigating trackers that map subdomains to third-party IP addresses. Adding blocking for known tracking query parameters in links.\nAdding noise to fingerprintable web APIs.\nAdding console log messages when blocking requests to known trackers. Adding support for blocking trackers that use third-party CNAME cloaking.\nAdding support for Private Click Measurement for direct response advertising, similar to how it works for in-app direct response advertising.\nText cursor color\nOn macOS Sonoma, the redesigned text cursor now uses the system accent color and matches iOS behavior. You can still customize the color with the caret-color CSS property.\nLive Text\nSafari 17 adds support for vertical text recognition in images and videos.\nApple Pay via Payment Request API\nYou can now enable Apple Pay to be used in third-party iframes by setting the allow="payment" attribute. This “permissions policy” enables the Payment Request API on an iframe, allowing you to embed third-party payment handlers. If using this feature, be sure you also use the X-Frames-Options HTTP header to prevent your site from being embedded by malicious websites.\nAuthentication\nSafari 17 adds support for largeBlob extension for passkeys. Websites can use the additional storage to save data that can later be retrieved when signing in with a passkey. These saved blobs are synced and shared along with passkeys.\nWe also are adding support for enterprise WebAuthn attestation for passkeys in iCloud Keychain. Managed devices can provide an attestation statement when creating passkeys, using a certificate provisioned through MDM.\nNetworking\nSafari 17 adds support for preconnect via HTTP Early Hints.\nLockdown mode\nLockdown mode now:\nDisables IndexedDB.\nDisables the File API and FileReader API.\nDisables support for the <embed> element. Disables the Web Speech (Speech Synthesis) API.\nDisables the WebLocks API.\nDisables support for experimental APIs. Supports select web fonts.\nLockdown Mode is also now supported in WebKit on watchOS.\nSafari Extensions\nSafari 17 now lets you customize where extensions run with even more granularity.\nFirst, Safari App Extensions now have the same per-site permissions model as Safari Web Extensions. It puts users in control over the browsing data they share with every extension they use in Safari.\nSecond, as an additional layer of control, Safari Extensions can be turned off in Private Browsing. Extensions that access browsing data, like browsing history or webpage contents, will be off by default in Private Browsing but can be allowed with a single toggle in Safari Settings.\nThird, all Safari Extensions can be turned on or off per Safari Profile. You can imagine this being useful for turning on an extension used only for school or work in a relevant profile, but keeping it off everywhere else. Each profile runs a separate instance of the extension — meaning there are unique storage areas, background pages, service workers, and more. However, per-site permissions are shared across profiles, so an extension only needs to be granted once. If your extension leverages native messaging capabilities to communicate with a host app, it’s possible to distinguish between profiles to ensure your extension behaves correctly across profiles.\nLearn more by watching What’s new in Safari extensions at WWDC23.\nBug Fixes and more\nTo learn even more about what’s in Safari 17 for web developers, including an extensive list of bug fixes, read the Safari 17 beta release notes.\nHelp us Beta Test\nYou can test Safari 17 beta by installing the beta of macOS Sonoma, iOS 17, or iPadOS 17.\nOr, if you’d like, you can try out Safari 17 beta on macOS Ventura or macOS Monterey by downloading the Safari 17.0 public beta, once it’s available later this summer. You will need to sign in using a free Apple ID to download.

PreviouslyWeb technology sessions at WWDC23Learn more News from WWDC23: WebKit Features in Safari 17 betaJun 6, 2023by Patrick Angle, Jean-Yves Avenard, Marcos Caceres, Ada Rose Cannon, Eric Carlson, Garrett Davidson, Jon Davis, Karl Dubost, Brady Eidson, Matthew Finkel, Simon Fraser, Brent Fulgham, Rachel Ginsberg, David Johnson, Anne van Kesteren, Mark Lam, Sihui Liu, Justin Michaud, Jer Noble, Tim Nguyen, Ben Nham, Richard Robinson, Michael Saboff, Alexey Shvaika, Jen Simmons, Sam Sneddon, Brandon Stewart, John Wilander, Luming YinIt’s been a fantastic year for WebKit. We’ve shipped eight Safari releases since WWDC22, with more than 140 new web technologies in the first half of 2023 alone. Now, we are pleased to announce another 88 web features coming this fall in Safari 17.Web AppsWeb apps are coming to Mac. With macOS Sonoma, you can add a website — any website — to your Dock. Just go to File > Add to Dock, adjust the name and icon if desired, and the web app icon appears in your Dock.Web apps on Mac let you focus on the websites you use all the time, separate from the rest of your browsing. Like all Mac apps, web apps work great with Stage Manager, Mission Control, and keyboard shortcuts like Command + Tab. Web apps can be opened from the Dock, Launchpad, and Spotlight Search. Web apps work with AutoFill credentials from iCloud Keychain and from third-party apps that have adopted the Credential Provider Extension API. And users can grant permission to a web app to use their camera, microphone and location in the same way they grant such permissions to other Mac apps through system prompts and the Privacy & Security section of System Settings. Web apps on Mac support web push, badging, and all the usual web standards implemented by WebKit, just like web apps on iOS and iPadOS.When a user clicks on a web app icon, the website always opens in its own window as a web app, even if the site does not have a manifest file (or legacy meta tags). This expands the usefulness of web apps, putting users in charge of determining what becomes a web app and giving them the confidence it’s always something they can choose.While the default web app experience on Mac is great, as a web app developer you can use web technologies like Service Workers to make it even better. By providing a web app manifest, you can customize the presentation of your web app, including the display mode, name, theme color, and start URL. Learn about the details by watching What’s new in Web Apps at WWDC23.When a user adds a website to their Dock, Safari will copy the website’s cookies to the web app. That way, if someone is logged into their account in Safari, they will remain logged in within the web app. This will only work if the authentication state is stored within cookies. Safari does not copy over any other kind of local storage. After a user adds a web app to the Dock, no other website data is shared, which is great for privacy.Add to Home Screen from Safari View ControllerAdd to Home Screen is now available from Safari View Controller on iOS and iPadOS. Tapping a link within an app that uses Safari View Controller as the in-app browser allows the user to add the open website to their Home Screen right from there. Just like Add to Home Screen from Safari on iOS and iPadOS (or any other browser that implemented support), if the website has a manifest file with a display mode of standalone or fullscreen, it will open as a Home Screen web app.Spatial WebWe can’t wait for you to try out Safari on Vision Pro. This truly is Safari, with the same WebKit engine — plus a few additions. All of your websites will work beautifully out of the box, thanks to its extensive support for web standards. You can see exactly how Safari on Vision Pro works by watching the WWDC23 Keynote and Meet Safari for spatial computing.We are collaborating on two technologies to make the web in spatial computing even more powerful — the <model> element and WebXR.ModelThe <model> element will provide a way to easily present 3D content in a web page without any scripting. Just like with <img> and <video>, HTML makes it possible for <model> to work in a robust and simple manner across web browsers on any platform. Model is still undergoing standardization and is subject to change, but we expect it will work like this:By creating a declarative element, we can leverage well-known patterns for supporting multiple file formats, while simultaneously providing fallbacks for browsers without support.The interactive attribute will enable user interaction and allow people to rotate the model in place. An accompanying JavaScript API will provide even more capabilities, including access to the camera. The exact details of how <model> will work are currently being debated at the Immersive Web Community Group.The ability to embed rich 3D content into a web page will open up a world of possibilities. For example, an online shoe store might provide models of all their shoes. Or a website for interior design inspiration could provide furniture models for people to “place” virtually in their homes. Safari on Vision Pro will take such experiences to the next level, with a full stereoscopic view and environmental lighting — all in a privacy-preserving way. What or where the user is looking is never exposed to the web page.You can try out <model> in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS by turning on its feature flag and navigating to this demo page.WebXRWhen embedding a 3D model into a web page isn’t enough, WebXR provides the technology for creating a fully immersive experience on the web. WebXR is based on WebGL, and many popular WebGL libraries already have built in support.Safari on Vision Pro currently has testable support for WebXR, available behind a feature flag while we collaborate with the W3C Immersive Web Working Group on updates to the web standard. WebKit supports the immersive-vr session type in WebXR. Vision Pro does not have external controllers. Instead, you can request the “hand-tracking” feature to let users interact with your content.Visit the Immersive Web Working Group developer page at immersiveweb.dev to learn more about getting started with different frameworks that include WebXR support and to find one that best fits your project.ImagesJPEG XLWe are pleased to announce that support for JPEG XL is coming to Safari 17. Similar to JPEG, the new image format provides another modern option for finding the right balance between quality and file size. JPEG XL uses a new compression algorithm called “Modular Entropy Coding” that allows for greater flexibility in adjusting the compression ratio. With support for progressive loading, it’s well suited for images served over slow connections, since users start to see the image before the whole file is downloaded. And you can recompress existing JPEG files into JPEG XL without any loss of data, while reducing their size by an average of 20%. Or compress from the original image file to create a file that’s up to 60% smaller compared to JPEG!Use the <picture> element to provide JPEG XL files to browsers that have support, while providing a fallback for browsers that don’t.JPEG XL will be supported by WebKit for Safari 17, Safari View Controller and WKWebView on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, as well as iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS.HEICWe are also adding support for HEIC images to Safari 17, which uses the HEVC video codec compression algorithm. HEIC is the file format used on iPhone and iPad to store photos taken with the camera. With support for HEIC in Safari, Safari View Controller, and WKWebView, developers can support importing and editing such photos right in the browser, without needing to convert them into another format. HEIC is also ideal for displaying images when using WKWebView inside an app.Image setSafari 17 also improves our implementation of image-set(), increasing interoperability with other browsers as part of our commitment to Interop 2023 , and adding support for the optional resolution and type arguments. The type argument provides you with a means to offer browsers multiple image formats to choose from, including JPEG XL and HEIC.VideoManaged Media SourceWebKit for Safari 17 also brings the new Managed Media Source API. It provides a power-efficient solution fulfilling advanced needs as a low-level toolkit for streaming video.Adaptive bitrate streaming allows for switching between media data formats — ensuring delivery of the best possible video quality based on the user’s internet connection speed and device capabilities, even as those conditions change. Media Source Extensions (MSE) is an existing low-level toolkit for adaptive streaming giving the web page more control and responsibilities for managing buffering and resolution. But MSE isn’t particularly good at managing buffer levels, network access, and media variant selection. And it uses a lot of power on mobile devices.Managed Media Source adds the capabilities of MSE, without any of the drawbacks. It’s available on iPadOS 17 beta and macOS Sonoma beta, and is in preview on iOS 17 beta, where it can be tested by turning on its feature flag. Note that Managed Media Source is only made available when an AirPlay source alternative is present.Learn more about JPEG XL, HEIC, and Managed Media Source API by watching Explore media formats for the web at WWDC23.Media player stats overlayIf you’ve enabled Developer Features, WebKit now provides a media player stats overlay where you can see technical details about a video — its source type, size, performance metrics, resolution, codec string, and color configuration. To show the overlay, use the context menu on any <video> element and select “Show Media Stats”. Now you can tell at a glance the exact codec and configuration used by media on your page and use that information to craft accurate queries in MediaCapabilities.And more videoWebKit now supports USB cameras on iPadOS 17. When a USB camera is attached to an iPad, it’s included in the output of enumerateDevices() and is selectable with getUserMedia() along with the built-in cameras.Improvements to WebRTC add support for InputDeviceInfo, the inbound rtp trackIdentifier stat field, exposing zoom in MediaTrackCapabilities, and getDisplayMedia video track clone resizing.WebKit for Safari 17 adds additional support for low-power mode — optimizing video streaming by tone mapping HDR video to SDR.HTMLPopoverSafari 17 adds support for the popover attribute. It provides a framework for displaying overlays, popups, popovers, and dialogs. There are two types of popovers, which can be used as values for the popover attribute:Use a button (either a <button> element or button input type) to create the UI for opening and closing the popover. And add the appropriate HTML attributes to create the desired result.The popovertarget attribute connects the button to the popover content through an ID. The optional popovertargetaction attribute takes show, hide, or toggle as values. By default, toggle is used.This is just one UI pattern you might find useful. There are many possible combinations. Having a popover mechanism in HTML makes for quick work, while ensuring great usability and full accessibility.To go beyond a simple button trigger, a JavaScript API opens up more powerful possibilities through showPopover(), hidePopover(), and togglePopover().And more HTMLSafari 17 on macOS adds support for <hr> inside of <select>, which is a feature the WebKit team added to the HTML Standard. This makes it easier to create a visual separator between items without requiring the use of JavaScript.The <menu> element is now mapped to role=list. Slotted elements are now announced when inside <dialog> or aria-modal. And now slot elements referenced with aria-labelledby are properly labeled.CSSCounter stylesSafari 17 adds support for CSS Counter Styles, providing a mechanism through @counter-style for changing a counter’s language or character set in CSS — both for ordered/unordered lists with list-style-type, and for CSS Counters.Font size adjustIn Safari 16.4, we shipped initial support for font-size-adjust, which allows you to easily make the visual size of different fonts consistent — even across all possible combinations of fallback fonts. The basic version of font-size-adjust lets you tell the browser to resize letters so that their x-height is a specific ratio of the font-size.In Safari 17, we’re expanding support to include more advance capabilities of font-size-adjust, including the from-font value and two-value syntax. Instead of declaring a ratio with a number value, the from-font value allows you to ask the browser to pull the sizing metric from the main font being specified, and apply that ratio to all fonts. Two-value syntax lets you switch from adjusting ex-height to adjusting cap-height, ch-width, ic-width, or ic-height — providing support for a broader range of languages and design choices.Let’s look at an example. Here, font-size-adjust tells the browser to make all of the fonts inside article match the size of the x-height of the main font being used. This means all of the text in paragraphs and code will visually appear to be the same size, no matter which font is applied from either stack, or how different the paragraph and code fonts appear in actual size.To learn much more about how font-size-adjust works, as well as all about Counter Styles, watch What’s new in CSS at WWDC23.Safari 17 also brings support for @font-face size-adjust, which provides a way for you to normalize visual size when defining a font’s use.Text transformSafari 17 adds support for text-transform: full-width and full-size-kana, and adds support for multiple text-transform values. The full-width value transforms all the characters in a string of text to be “full-width” — to match the size of characters in an East Asian script like those for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. It’s especially useful when wanting to improve consistency in sizing when typesetting CJK. The full-size-kana value transforms the size of Kana characters in Japanese to be full-size, rather than the typical small size — useful to make ruby text more legible when needed.Font supportTo expand what’s possible with web typography, Safari 17 adds two feature queries for writing CSS depending on the presence or absence of browser support for font tech or format: @supports font-tech() as well as @supports font-format(). Font tech refers to specific kinds of OpenType technology used in some fonts, like COLRv0. Safari 17 also adds support for @font-face { src: url() tech() }, making it easy to define the use of a font that depends on newer tech, while providing a fallback for browsers without support.Media Queries 4Safari 17 rounds out support for Media Queries level 4, with support for two new media queries. Like the others, overflow-block and overflow-inline provide a way to conditionally apply CSS depending on the qualities of a user’s device — in this case, how the device handles overflow. For example, can it scroll the page like a typical browser on a computer? Does it page the content, like an e-book reader? Or does it have no mechanism for handling overflow, like a digital billboard?And more CSSWebKit for Safari 17 includes multiple fixes to improve accessibility of display: contents, including making aria-activedescendant, aria-dropeffect, aria-flowto, aria-grabbed, aria-owns, AXAccessKey, CSS speak-as, and URL AX APIs work on elements that have display: contents applied. As well as computing the accessible name for display: contents elements that rely on labels or captions, and making display: contents elements to be able to return selected accessibility children.Safari 17 also adds support for contain-intrinsic-size, providing a way to set the size of an element to use for layout when the element is subject to size containment.To increase the usefulness of :has(), WebKit now supports :has(:buffering) and :has(:stalled) to expand the ability to apply CSS conditionally based on the state of media playback. And Safari 17 supports :has(:defined) for applying styling based on the presence of a custom element that has been defined.To keep up with the most recent changes to the web standard for Container Queries, Safari 17 adds support for containerName and containerQuery, and updates conditionText to be containerName containerQuery in CSSContainerRule.JavaScript and Web APIOffscreen CanvasWhen using Canvas, the rendering, animation, and user interaction usually happens on the main execution thread of a web application. Offscreen Canvas provides a canvas that can be rendered off-screen, decoupling the DOM and the Canvas API so that the <canvas> element is no longer entirely dependent on the DOM. Rendering can be transferred to a worker context, allowing you to run tasks in a separate thread and avoid heavy work on the main thread that can negatively impact the user experience. The combination of DOM-independent operations and rendering of the main thread can provide a significantly better experience for users, especially on low-power devices. Support for Offscreen Canvas 2D operations shipped in Safari 16.4. Now, Safari 17 adds support for 3D contexts in Offscreen Canvas.StorageWebKit has made some big updates to the storage quota policy. Previously, an origin had a starting storage limit of 1 GB. When exceeding the limit, the subsequent storage operation would fail in Home Screen web apps, or the user would see a prompt asking to increase the quota for the origin in Safari. Starting in macOS Sonoma, iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, the quota is calculated based on total disk space without the user’s input. The origin generally gets a much higher limit, and the user isn’t prompted in Safari. To get the estimated value of the current origin quota and usage, you can use the newly supported navigator.storage.estimate() method.As each origin gets a higher storage limit by default, WebKit will evict data by origin when the total usage of all origins is bigger than a certain value, the “overall quota”, calculated based on total disk space. An origin is exempt from eviction when its storage mode is persistent. To check the storage mode of your origin, you can use navigator.storage.persisted(); to request the mode be changed to persistent, you can use navigator.storage.persist(). Critical bug fixes have been made to ensure the storage mode value is remembered across sessions, and eviction will count on it. The Storage API is now fully supported.RegExSafari 17 adds JavaScript support for two new Regular Expression features, RegExp v flag with set notation + properties of strings and RegExp duplicate named capture groups. The RegExp v flag feature allows for the creation of regular expressions containing Unicode properties, including some multi-character Emoji sequences. It also allows for creating regular expressions with union, intersection, and subtraction set operations on character classes and collections of strings.The Duplicate Named Capture Group feature enables the creation of regular expressions with named captures where more than one capture group uses the same name. This allows you to create regular expressions with intuitive group names where there is more than a one-way pattern to search. An example is creating one regular expression that can search data strings written in multiple ways, e.g. M/D/Y versus D-M-Y, while extracting the matched results with captured group names month, day, and year regardless of which string format was matched.Set OperationsAnother new JavaScript feature adds several new Set operation methods, including intersection() and union() as well as comparison methods including difference(), isSubsetOf() and isSuperSetOf(). Together these new methods make Sets first class objects.And so on. Check out also the new .symmetricDifference() and .isDisjointFrom() methods, which open some interesting comparison possibilities.Gamepad APIWebKit for Safari 17 adds support for Gamepad.prototype.vibrationActuator. It enables “dual-rumble” haptic feedback on gamepads. The API allows you to check if “dual-rumble” is supported by the gamepad, as well as control the duration and magnitude of the haptic effect.URL APITraditionally, to ensure you could parse a URL, you needed to use a try sequence. Now, you can directly detect if an URL input can be parsed with URL.canParse(tentativeURL, optionalBase). The method will return true or false.In addition, the has() and delete() methods on URLSearchParams have been extended. The has() method makes it possible to detect if a parameter has been set. And the delete() method can delete a parameter. Until now, you could only check for, and delete, by name alone. Now, the methods have been extended so that you can check for, and delete, specific name-value pairs.For example, the following URL has currency as a duplicate key: https://example.com/?currency=USD&currency=JPY, before you could only check params.has('currency'). It is now possible to do: params.has('currency', 'JPY').Be mindful that with this update, method signatures are not directly feature detectable, so they can return false positives. Until all browsers support these updates, be sure to run a small test to confirm support. For example:Web SocketsYou can now use relative URLs (as well as HTTP(S) URLs) in the WebSocket constructor — this makes it a lot easier to point to WebSocket endpoints without hard-coding URLs into your web application. For example, new WebSocket('/updates').And more JavaScript and Web APIWeb Developer ToolsRedesigned Develop MenuIn Safari 17 on macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura and macOS Monterey, a completely redesigned Develop menu makes it easier to find the key tools available to help you create websites, web apps, web content inside other apps, web extensions, and more.Devices and simulators are now more prominent in the Develop menu, making them easier to identify at a glance. Inside the menu for each iOS or iPadOS device, app icons make it easier to find the application or web content you want to inspect. On macOS Sonoma you can pair with Apple TV and Vision Pro directly from Safari to inspect those platforms.Rethought Feature FlagsThe new Feature Flags panel replaces the previous Experimental Features section of the Develop menu, allowing you to search for specific features and to easily see bolded features toggled from their default state. Feature flags are now organized by topic: Animation, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Media and more. And each feature is clearly categorized into one of four statuses: Stable, Testable, Preview, and Developer.Stable represents features that have recently shipped in Safari, on by default. These features can be turned off to help you debug an issue or test progressive enhancements. Stable features will eventually be removed from the list.Testable features are disabled by default. These features might be in the process of being implemented, or they might be waiting for changes to the web standards. They have a ways to go, but still could be interesting enough to test out.Preview is for features that have not yet shipped in Safari, but are closer to being complete. These features are on by default in Safari Technology Preview, and are ready for developers to try out. They may still have bugs, or may even undergo significant change as web standards evolve. This is a great time to help find and file bugs, and to comment on whether the web standard for a new technologies solves your needs.Developer features are not as common. This category is for miscellaneous features added to the list of feature flags so developers can toggle them on and off for testing. Developer tools may appear here, for example.New Developer settings panelThe new Developer panel in Safari 17’s Settings let you toggle developer features that apply across all websites open in Safari, like Allow remote automation (which enables automating Safari with WebDriver) and other features that were previously in the Develop menu.New tab-specific setting overlaySome previously-global settings from the Develop menu, like disabling CSS or changing WebRTC behavior, have moved to Web Inspector where they are now scoped to the inspected tab, allowing you to use other tabs and windows normally.Redesigned Responsive Web Design ModeResponsive Design Mode has also been refreshed to focus on the responsiveness of a page’s design at any width or height on your Mac. You can type in a specific viewport size at the top of Responsive Design Mode in addition to dragging the resize handles around the view.Also new is the ability to open the page in a Simulator right from Responsive Design Mode.SimulatorsYou can also open any page from Safari in a Simulator directly from the Develop > Open Page With menu, even when you are not using Responsive Design Mode.Using a Simulator is a great way to test the experiences you’re making on iOS, iPadOS, and coming soon, visionOS — including device-specific behaviors, like the rendered size of type, the effects of the viewport meta tag, double-tap to zoom, and even Home Screen web apps on iOS and iPadOS. Simulators are free, and come included with Xcode from the Mac App Store.If you don’t have Xcode installed, a link to documentation is conveniently available in the Develop > Open Page With menu, as well as the Open with Simulator menu in Responsive Design Mode, to help you get started, or to add more devices and OS versions.Learn all about the new Develop menu, redesigned Responsive Web Design mode, how to easily connect to directly to a real device, how to install and use a Simulator, and much more in Rediscover Safari developer features at WWDC23.Web InspectorWe’ve also made improvements to Web Inspector. When working with minified sources, pretty printing in Web Inspector can help make the code easier to read, set breakpoints in, and debug. New in Safari 17, more JavaScript syntax is supported for pretty printing minified scripts, including template strings, optional chaining, private variables and functions in classes, and static variables and functions.Changes to Web Inspector in Safari 17 also include:Learn more by watching What’s new in Web Inspector at WWDC23.SecurityGPU ProcessLast year brought GPU process support to WebKit on iOS, iPadOS and watchOS. This year we’re adding support on macOS Sonoma. The change moves all drawing (including the drawing of page content, 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering) so it occurs in the “GPU Process”. This new architecture allows WebKit to isolate powerful graphics hardware and driver access away from the WebContent process, which is the process that interacts with untrusted content from the Internet. The new design also allows the WebContent process sandbox to completely block IOKit access, resulting in improved security.WebGLImprovements to WebGL include adding support for WEBGL_clip_cull_distance, EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2, EXT_polygon_offset_clamp and GPUExternalTexture.WebKit APINew interfaces are added to WKWebsiteDataStore and related classes to further unlock the potential of your WebKit apps. The new capabilities include creating persistent website data stores, configuring cookie policy, customizing proxy settings, requesting HTTPS upgrade for all navigations, and controlling state of inline prediction for autocomplete.Browser changesSafari ProfilesSafari 17 adds support for profiles. History, favorites, Tab Groups and website data such as cookies, caches, service workers, and Web Push subscriptions are scoped per-profile. Users can manage each profile’s data individually.Safari Private BrowsingIn Safari 17, Private Browsing gets even more private with added protection against some of the most advanced techniques used to track you. Technical changes include:Text cursor colorOn macOS Sonoma, the redesigned text cursor now uses the system accent color and matches iOS behavior. You can still customize the color with the caret-color CSS property.Live TextSafari 17 adds support for vertical text recognition in images and videos.Apple Pay via Payment Request APIYou can now enable Apple Pay to be used in third-party iframes by setting the allow="payment" attribute. This “permissions policy” enables the Payment Request API on an iframe, allowing you to embed third-party payment handlers. If using this feature, be sure you also use the X-Frames-Options HTTP header to prevent your site from being embedded by malicious websites.AuthenticationSafari 17 adds support for largeBlob extension for passkeys. Websites can use the additional storage to save data that can later be retrieved when signing in with a passkey. These saved blobs are synced and shared along with passkeys.We also are adding support for enterprise WebAuthn attestation for passkeys in iCloud Keychain. Managed devices can provide an attestation statement when creating passkeys, using a certificate provisioned through MDM.NetworkingSafari 17 adds support for preconnect via HTTP Early Hints.Lockdown modeLockdown mode now:Lockdown Mode is also now supported in WebKit on watchOS.Safari ExtensionsSafari 17 now lets you customize where extensions run with even more granularity.First, Safari App Extensions now have the same per-site permissions model as Safari Web Extensions. It puts users in control over the browsing data they share with every extension they use in Safari.Second, as an additional layer of control, Safari Extensions can be turned off in Private Browsing. Extensions that access browsing data, like browsing history or webpage contents, will be off by default in Private Browsing but can be allowed with a single toggle in Safari Settings.Third, all Safari Extensions can be turned on or off per Safari Profile. You can imagine this being useful for turning on an extension used only for school or work in a relevant profile, but keeping it off everywhere else. Each profile runs a separate instance of the extension — meaning there are unique storage areas, background pages, service workers, and more. However, per-site permissions are shared across profiles, so an extension only needs to be granted once. If your extension leverages native messaging capabilities to communicate with a host app, it’s possible to distinguish between profiles to ensure your extension behaves correctly across profiles.Learn more by watching What’s new in Safari extensions at WWDC23.Bug Fixes and moreTo learn even more about what’s in Safari 17 for web developers, including an extensive list of bug fixes, read the Safari 17 beta release notes.Help us Beta TestYou can test Safari 17 beta by installing the beta of macOS Sonoma, iOS 17, or iPadOS 17.Or, if you’d like, you can try out Safari 17 beta on macOS Ventura or macOS Monterey by downloading the Safari 17.0 public beta, once it’s available later this summer.

It is widely used for building web applications and APIs. GCP Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform that allows you to run your containerized applications with ease. Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application with all its dependencies into a single container. Gitlab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities.\\n\\nIn this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a Flask application on GCP Cloud Run with Docker and Gitlab. We will cover the following topics:\\n\\n1. Setting up a Flask application\\n2. Creating a Dockerfile for your Flask application\\n3. Deploying your Flask application to GCP Cloud Run\\n4. Setting up CI/CD with Gitlab\\n\\nSetting up a Flask application\\n\\nFirst, you need to create a Flask application. You can create a new Flask application by running the following command:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip install flask\\n$ mkdir myapp\\n$ cd myapp\\n$ touch app.py\\n```\\n\\nNext, open the app.py file and add the following code:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flask import Flask\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n@app.route('/')\\ndef hello_world():\\n    return 'Hello, World!'\\n```\\n\\nThis code creates a simple Flask application that returns \\"Hello, World!\\" when you visit the root URL.\\n\\nCreating a Dockerfile for your Flask application\\n\\nNext, you need to create a Dockerfile for your Flask application. The Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Here's an example Dockerfile for a Flask application:\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\n# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\\nFROM python:3.8-slim-buster\\n\\n# Set the working directory to /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app\\nCOPY . /app\\n\\n# Install the required packages\\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container\\nEXPOSE 8080\\n\\n# Define environment variable\\nENV NAME World\\n\\n# Run app.py when the container launches\\nCMD [\\"python\\", \\"app.py\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThis Dockerfile starts with an official Python 3.8 image, sets the working directory to /app, copies the contents of the current directory into the container, installs the required packages, exposes port 8080, sets an environment variable, and runs the app.py file when the container launches.\\n\\nDeploying your Flask application to GCP Cloud Run\\n\\nNow that you have created a Dockerfile for your Flask application, you can deploy it to GCP Cloud Run. Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. Install the Google Cloud SDK\\n2. Build the Docker image\\n3. Push the Docker image to Google Container Registry\\n4. Deploy the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run\\n\\nHere's an example command to build the Docker image:\\n\\n```\\n$ docker build -t myapp .\\n```\\n\\nThis command builds a Docker image with the tag \\"myapp\\".\\n\\nNext, you need to push the Docker image to Google Container Registry. Here's an example command:\\n\\n```\\n$ docker tag myapp gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n$ docker push gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n```\\n\\nThis command tags the Docker image with the registry name and pushes it to Google Container Registry.\\n\\nFinally, you can deploy the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run. Here's an example command:\\n\\n```\\n$ gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/myproject/myapp --platform managed\\n```\\n\\nThis command deploys the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run on the managed platform.\\n\\nSetting up CI/CD with Gitlab\\n\\nNow that you have deployed your Flask application to GCP Cloud Run, you can set up CI/CD with Gitlab. Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. Create a Gitlab repository for your Flask application\\n2. Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root directory of your repository\\n3. Define the stages and jobs for your CI/CD pipeline\\n4. Add the CI/CD variables to your Gitlab project\\n\\nHere's an example .gitlab-ci.yml file:\\n\\n```yaml\\nimage: docker:latest\\n\\nservices:\\n  - docker:dind\\n\\nstages:\\n  - build\\n  - test\\n  - deploy\\n\\nbuild:\\n  stage: build\\n  script:\\n    - docker build -t myapp .\\n    - docker tag myapp gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n    - echo \\"$GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT\\" > /tmp/key.json\\n    - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file /tmp/key.json\\n    - gcloud config set project myproject\\n    - gcloud auth configure-docker\\n    - docker push gcr.io/myproject/myapp\\n\\ntest:\\n  stage: test\\n  script:\\n    - echo \\"Running tests\\"\\n\\ndeploy:\\n  stage: deploy\\n  script:\\n    - gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/myproject/myapp --platform managed\\n```\\n\\nThis .gitlab-ci.yml file defines three stages: build, test, and deploy. The build stage builds the Docker image, tags it, and pushes it to Google Container Registry. The test stage runs any tests that you have defined. The deploy stage deploys the Docker image to GCP Cloud Run.\\n\\nFinally, you need to add the CI/CD variables to your Gitlab project. Here are the variables that you need to add:\\n\\n- GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: The JSON key for your GCP service account\\n- GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID: The ID of your GCP project\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this guide, we have shown you how to set up a Flask application on GCP Cloud Run with Docker and Gitlab. We have covered the basics of Flask, Docker, and GCP Cloud Run, and we have shown you how to deploy your application to GCP Cloud Run and set up CI/CD with Gitlab. We hope that this guide has been helpful to you and that you are now ready to build your own Flask application on GCP Cloud Run with Docker and Gitlab."}

These paper reviews can be delivered weekly to your inbox, or you can subscribe to the Atom feed. As always, feel free to reach out on Twitter with feedback or suggestions!TelaMalloc: Efficient On-Chip Memory Allocation for Production Machine Learning AcceleratorsA common pattern for integrating machine learning models with applications is deploying them to user devices, where the models run on local hardwareSee Apple’s guide to deploying transformers to the Apple Neural Engine. . Running models locally provides performance improvements (by eliminating communication with a cloud), while enabling private computing. Unfortunately, there are also challenges to running models locally because of diversity in hardware capabilities - a program that works well on the highest end modern phone may not perform optimally on previous generation devices.To effectively run on a user’s device, the software must efficiently use local resources, including memory. The problem of allocating memory has been studied extensivelySee Dynamic Storage Allocation: A Survey and Critical Review. , but ML models pose novel challenges. Specifically, memory allocation for ML models is a 2D bin-packing problemThere is a large amount of research on solving this problem - see Survey on two-dimensional packing and the Wikipedia reference. - unlike programs which grow and shrink their memory usage over time, ML models have strict requirements for memory allocations because certain parts of the model depend on others.Existing solutionsThe paper cites XLA, TFLite (optimized for mobile devices), and Apache TVM. for ML model memory allocation rely on heuristics or solvers (which can produce a closer to optimal output, but often take longer to run). The Telamalloc paper proposes a solution balancing a combination of heuristics and solvers. As a result, the research is able to tackle the challenge posed by wide variance in hardware capabilities, significantly reducing the time that it takes the model to allocate memory and run.What are the paper’s contributions?The paper makes three main contributions:How does the system work?The system takes the problem and turns it into a 2D-optimization problem, where memory blocks are assigned to different ranges of address space over time, based on the flow of the program.The authors aim the approach at tensor memory allocation both on mobile devices and in Tensor Processing UnitsSee An in-depth look at Google’s first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). , a custom piece of hardware that is used for machine learning at scale.It is worth noting how well studied resource allocation is - the paper reviews the standard approach compilers follow to:1) take a graph representation of the model and perform various graph transformations, 2) divide the graph into smaller units of work (operators), and 3) map these operators to different units of hardware.The authors call the third component the mapping problem, and note it is fundamentally different than the problem they’re focused on, which they call the memory allocation problem:the mapping problem is concerned with determining which level of a memory hierarchy to map each buffer to, the memory allocation problem selects buffer locations within addressable scratchpad memories that are shared between multiple buffers with overlapping live ranges.Notably, the performance of solving the memory allocation problem impacts users. If the compilation of a model takes a long time, an application using a model won’t work. On the other hand, if the problem is solved quickly, but suboptimally, the model may not be able to successfully allocate memory (because it attempts to use too much memory).Problem FormulationThe authors represent the problem by providing a set of buffers with start, end, and size to the allocator, along with an upper limit to memory usage.The allocator then attempts to produce a solution mapping each buffer to an address, where none of the buffers overlap, and memory usage doesn’t exceed the specified limit.Memory Allocation HeuristicsThe paper describes three main heuristics for assigning buffers to addresses: best-fit, greedy, the approach Telamalloc implements (which is a combination of both).A best-fit allocator assigns buffers to address space in start time orderThe paper mentions that Tensorflow uses this strategy with its best-fit with coalescing (BFC) allocator. . The paper notes, “This approach works well if memory is abundant but fails if the memory budget is tight” because memory allocations of many blocks in a constrained space will be suboptimal.The greedy approach (used by TFLite) takes, “the end time into account to pick locations one buffer at time, while ensuring that it does not overlap with any previously allocated buffers.” Again, this approach doesn’t do well when memory is tight because it also produces suboptimal solutions.Lastly, there is the heuristic that Telamalloc implements, which takes into account the contention of a point of time (represented by the number of buffers that need to be assigned). Buffers with the highest contention are placed first at the lowest possible address (stored by keeping a “skyline” for each time period)This is reminiscent of the Skyline Problem! . If there are multiple buffers, the heuristic makes a decision based on other factors like the length of time a buffer exists.Solver-based ApproachesHeuristics for memory allocation have several downsides, including that their performance depends on the specific workload and problem difficulty - “once a heuristic has made a wrong decision that prevents it from solving the problem, it has no way to recover.” To address the shortcomings of heuristic failure, Telamalloc integrates a solver-basedIn particular, the paper relies on integer liner programming (ILP), described in more detail here. approach that represents the problem with several constraints, including all of the buffers taking up space at a given time can not exceed memory and buffers can not overlap.Telamalloc OverviewAs mentioned earlier, Telamalloc doesn’t solely rely on heuristics, nor solvers - heuristics get stuck on certain cases, and solvers can take too long. Normally solversThe paper specifically refers to a solver framework from Google, capable of representing a wide variety of constraints and problems. return the whole solution given an input and a set of constraints - instead, the program that guides the solver integrates interactively, reading the state of the solver for a particular buffer and making choices, then responding to feedback.At each step, the Search Heuristic chooses from the remaining unplaced blocksIt chooses blocks based on the following heuristics in order, “(1) The block with the longest lifetime (end-start time). (2) The block with the largest size. (3) The block with the largest area (i.e., size × lifetime).” , and “backtracks” to undo choices if a state it ends up in is invalid. It splits backtracking into “minor” and “major” based on how many steps need to be undone - the former corresponds to a single buffer placement, whereas the latter corresponds to undoing a whole line of choices (because the final state is invalid).The authors describe a number of optimizations to implement smart backtracking. Several of these focus on avoiding a return to the conditions that caused the initial backtrack. For example, on failure to satisfy constraints, the solver reports which placements occurred, so the search algorithm can unwind them quickly. Another example optimization is explicitly prioritizing buffers whose placement (or inability to place) led to a major backtrack - “this avoids cases where the solver got stuck by ignoring blocks that were important but not among the largest or longest-lived blocks”.Lastly, Telamalloc groups together buffers that contend with one another into phases, then runs the algorithm over each phase. This approach reduces the complexity of the problem, and allows choosing from a smaller set of candidate buffers when making choices.How is the research evaluated?The paper considers two main aspects of Telamalloc: microbenchmarks evaluating the algorithm in isolation, and measurements from compiling models / making memory allocations on a Pixel 6.The microbenchmarks consider the time to compute memory placements in the best and worst cases. In normal conditions, Telamalloc completes incredibly quickly (“≈10-100us for common problem sizes”). The worst case is represented by a large number of blocks (one thousand) with full overlap - in this situation, Telamalloc takes around 100000 ms, and each step takes significantly longer due to the strain placed on the solver (which needs to consider how a candidates interacts with many different potential placements).When comparing Telamalloc’s compilation of common models on the Pixel 6 running against a solver (which is capable of achieving near-optimal results given enough time), the memory allocations Telamalloc produces are nearly identical. Telamalloc is also able to achieve a, “median speedup of ≈ 4.7× across the benchmark”.ConclusionTelamalloc is an interesting paper because it discusses a combination of existing algorithms with optimizations tailored to improve user experiences relying on ML models. The paper also discusses using ML to make the performance of “smart” backtracking better - the idea of feeding in-the-wild data back into an algorithm to improve it over time is fascinating to me. This pattern also shows up in places like Java’s JIT compiler which takes data about a program’s performance and execution, then uses that to make the program better over time. Beyond the technical details of the paper, I also appreciated its focus on the impact to users - being able to compile models efficiently and successfully across a wide range of hardware is critical to making new AI-powered capabilities accessible to all.\nFollow me on\nTwitter or subscribe\nbelow to get future paper reviews.

While some developers advocate for its use, others are against it. In this article, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of using an ORM and provide insights into the data model vs domain model debate.\n\n## Why Use an ORM?\n\nWriting data access code can be tedious and time-consuming. There is a lot of boilerplate code involved, and making a mistake can easily cause serious and hard-to-debug issues like connection pool exhaustion. ORM's have already implemented and tested all this functionality for you, making it easier to write data access code.\n\nORM's provide automatic mapping and type-safe queries, which reduces the risk of errors. There is often a lot of mapping code required to map between the object model and the SQL statements. It's easy to make mistakes here, such as typos or forgetting to include the right columns in your queries. Every time you change your database schema, you have to make sure you manually update your object model and queries, which can lead to bugs. ORM's solve these issues by providing automatic mapping and type-safe queries.\n\n## Data Model vs Domain Model\n\nORM's try to solve the object-relational impedance mismatch, which means there's often no one-to-one relation between your database tables and your domain model. Depending on your application architecture, there can be a variety of reasons for this, such as normalization and inheritance.\n\nWhen we talk about a domain model, we don't necessarily mean it in the typical Domain-Driven Design (DDD) sense. It can be any object model that you use in your application code. The main issue with this type of complicated mapping is that it's not easy for the ORM to generate optimized queries. If you're querying for an object that maps to multiple database tables, the resulting SQL statement will contain a bunch of joins. If your object is part of an inheritance chain, it'll probably add some additional predicates to those join statements. You have little control over what the eventual query will look like because it's based on the configured mapping.\n\nWe advocate for separating your domain model from your data model. By defining a data model that's a one-on-one reflection of your database tables, you can maintain control of your SQL statements without giving up the advantages of using an ORM. Every class corresponds to a single table, so you can easily predict what your SQL statements will look like and which joins will be produced. There won't be any hidden magic involved since the ORM doesn't have to do any complex mapping.\n\nIf you want to use a DDD approach and define aggregates, you can create separate objects to make up your domain model. You can map the classes from the data model to the domain model whenever necessary. When using a strongly typed language, these kinds of mappings are easy to test and refactor because they're checked by the compiler. A similar approach can be taken if you use another architecture, such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).\n\nIn conclusion, ORM's can be advantageous in reducing the time and effort required to write data access code. However, it's essential to consider the data model vs domain model debate and separate them to maintain control of your SQL statements and optimize your queries.

However, there is no need to fret! This blog post endeavors to explore the realm of refactoring, whereby we untangle our chaotic code and transfigure it into an elegant, modular, and comprehensible solution.Before we start, what is spaghetti code?Spaghetti code refers to source code that is messy and difficult to understand. It has a tangled structure, making it hard to maintain and likely to have errors.Let’s explore an example of spaghetti code:Let’s approach the situation step by step and try to untangle the mess.Identify the ProblemOne of the initial issues we face is the lack of meaningful variable names. Meaningful and descriptive names greatly enhance code readability. To untangle the code, our first step is to rename variables so that they accurately represent their purpose, making the code self-explanatory. This best practice improves our own understanding and helps future developers working on the code.The code’s lack of modularity is evident in the oversized Main function that performs multiple tasks. To tackle this problem, we will break down the Main function and identify separate functionalities. These will be extracted into their own functions or classes. This approach allows us to group related logic together, promote code reusability, and enhance the overall structure of the codebase.Another important aspect that needs improvement is the code’s limited error handling. Effective error handling is crucial for identifying and gracefully recovering from unexpected situations. To address this, we will examine potential exceptions that may occur during the code’s execution. We will then implement appropriate error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, to ensure the code handles exceptions smoothly and provides helpful error messages.The code contains numerous complex if-else conditions, making it difficult to read and understand. To simplify this, we will utilize techniques like switch statements, polymorphism, or design patterns such as the strategy pattern. These approaches help streamline conditional logic and reduce its complexity. By doing so, we improve the code’s readability, maintainability, and make it easier to modify in the future.Break it DownTo begin untangling the code, our first step is to split it into smaller, manageable chunks. This allows us to focus on specific functionalities and improve modularity. By breaking down the code into smaller parts, we can isolate and understand individual components more effectively, making it easier to maintain and enhance the codebase.To improve the modularity of the code, we can start by separating the logic responsible for determining the number type and the logic for printing numbers into separate functions or classes.Use Descriptive NamesTo enhance code readability and maintainability, it’s essential to give meaningful names to variables and methods. Let’s apply this practice to the code by assigning appropriate names to the relevant elements.From:To:Use Design Patterns and PrinciplesTo enhance code readability and reduce the complexity of conditionals, we can employ the Strategy Pattern. The Strategy Pattern allows us to encapsulate different algorithms or strategies and dynamically select one at runtime. Here’s how we can apply the Strategy Pattern to replace complex conditionals:From:To:By utilizing the Strategy Pattern, we achieve a more modular and maintainable code structure. It simplifies the complex conditional logic, improves code readability, and makes it easier to extend or modify the behavior in the future.Improve Error HandlingThe original code had minimal error handling. Let’s improve that.From:To:Final TouchesWe can enhance readability by using string interpolation.From:To:And there you have it! Our final, refactored code is clear, modular, and “easy” to understand.Cyclomatic ComplexityCyclomatic Complexity (CC) is a metric that measures the complexity of a program. It quantifies the number of independent paths through the program’s source code. For simple if-else constructs, you can estimate the cyclomatic complexity by counting the decision points (such as if, while, for statements) and adding one.In the old code:Adding them up and adding one, the cyclomatic complexity is 9.In the new code:The cyclomatic complexity of the new code is 4.Reducing cyclomatic complexity simplifies the code, reduces the likelihood of errors, and improves maintainability.FinallyIn conclusion, through refactoring, we’ve made our code more maintainable, easier to understand, and reduced the cyclomatic complexity from 9 to 4. It’s a solid win for any developer.Remember, great code is not about how complex you can make it, but how simple you can make it. As Albert Einstein said, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler”. Happy coding!P.S.

In this article, we will delve into the two primary memory locations for object allocation in C#: the heap and the stack. By grasping these concepts, you’ll be equipped with valuable insights that can help you write high-performance C# applications.\\n\\nHeap vs. Stack: Unveiling the Allocation Paradigm\\n\\nIn C#, objects can be stored either on the heap or the stack, and comprehending the differences between these two memory locations is essential. The stack is used for storing value types and reference types that are declared as local variables or method parameters. When a method is called, a new stack frame is created to store the method's local variables and parameters. When the method returns, the stack frame is popped, and the memory is automatically deallocated.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the heap is used for storing reference types that are created using the \\"new\\" keyword, and it's the responsibility of the garbage collector to free up the memory when it's no longer needed. The heap is a larger memory space than the stack, and it's not organized in a specific order like the stack.\\n\\nAllocating Objects: Reference Types and Value Types\\n\\nNow that we understand the basics of heap and stack memory, let’s explore how different types of objects are allocated in C#. Value types are allocated on the stack, and they are passed by value. Reference types, on the other hand, are allocated on the heap, and they are passed by reference.\\n\\nStarting with C# 7.2, you can declare a struct as a ref struct, ensuring it is always allocated on the stack and preventing it from being declared inside reference types. This can be useful for performance-critical scenarios where you want to avoid heap allocations.\\n\\nReference Semantics for Value Types\\n\\nWhile value types are typically passed by copy, C# provides mechanisms to allow accessing value types by reference, thus introducing reference semantics. The \\"ref\\" and \\"out\\" keywords can be used to pass value types by reference. The \\"in\\" keyword can be used to pass value types by reference without allowing them to be modified.\\n\\nMemory Management: Garbage Collection and the Heap\\n\\nOne of the critical aspects of managing memory in C# is understanding how the heap memory is freed up. When an object on the heap no longer has any references pointing to it, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. At a certain point, the garbage collector kicks in, interrupts running threads, invokes the finalizers of the objects it needs to collect (on a special finalizer thread), and then marks the memory as available for reuse.\\n\\nThe Large Object Heap (LOH): A Special Memory Space\\n\\nIn C#, the heap is further divided into the Small Object Heap (SOH) and the Large Object Heap (LOH). This separation is primarily to address memory fragmentation and optimize memory usage. The SOH is used for objects smaller than 85,000 bytes, while the LOH is used for larger objects.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Small Object Heap (SOH) and the Large Object Heap (LOH) is vital for memory optimization in your C# applications, as it allows you to make informed decisions regarding object size and memory allocation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, understanding object allocation in C# is crucial for writing high-performance applications. By grasping the differences between the heap and the stack, you can optimize memory usage and ensure efficient code execution. Knowing how value types and reference types are allocated, and how memory is managed through garbage collection, can help you write more efficient and effective code."}

Together with the secret sauce of in-cluster DNS resolution, you can run a\nprogram on your computer and have it access cluster-internal services that do not have any external IP. The\nprogram would also have access to third-party services that are open to IPs from your cluster, but not to your\nlocal IP.This can be useful for different cases, notably for running utility tools with access to the cluster, or for debugging\nnew services.Running utility programs with access to your cluster #When you run an application with mirrord, and the application connects to a network address or domain name, DNS\nresolution as well as the network connection will be done from the cluster. This lets you run tools locally for\nconfiguring or testing your services on the cluster.Let’s see what this looks like with a little practical example. We have a Kafka cluster set up on Kubernetes1:With mirrord we can use utility tools to manage and test the services on the cluster, with the same ease as if they\nwere running locally. Say we want to read some events from an existing weather-updates topic. We just run Kafka’s\nconsole client, and give it the name of the bootstrap service as its URL.The client connects to the bootstrap server, which tells it what Kafka brokers it should connect to, and it then\nfetches the events from those brokers.All of this works with a simple client running locally on the developer’s machine. No containerizing, no deployment,\nno setup. And the fun part is mirrord operates on the process level, so it doesn’t affect connectivity for the rest\nof your system. This means you can even run multiple applications accessing different clusters or different\nnamespaces at the same time.Access external services through the cluster #When you run an application with mirrord, the connections it initiates will be sent out of a temporary pod on your\nKubernetes cluster. This means your application can connect not only to services in the cluster, but to any\nendpoint in the internet that the cluster has access to. This can be useful if you want your application to\ncommunicate with external services that are configured to only accept communication from your cluster’s IP address,\nor if you want to test your cluster’s network connectivity to external services.In the screenshot below you can see what it looks like when we run curl ifconfig.me (a web service that returns\nthe IP you connect from in its response) with mirrord (IPs partially redacted). When we run the curl command with\nmirrord, it’s sent out of the cluster, so the cluster’s egress IP is returned.Debugging new services with targetless mirrord #Your microservices are deployed on the cluster, so far away. You can see they are there with kubectl. You can even\nport-forward to them. But if you are working on a brand-new microservice that communicates with your existing\nmicroservices, you can’t run it locally, because its requests to the other microservices will fail, especially if\naddressed by cluster-internal domain names. So close, and yet so far. So in order to test your new little service\nwhich barely even does anything, you have to create Kubernetes resources for it, package it in a container, deploy\nit to the cluster, right?Wrong, obviously.Just run it with mirrord, and when it makes requests to services on the cluster, they’ll just work. The DNS\nresolving will be performed on your cluster, and the network traffic will be emitted from within your cluster, so\nyour new little app won’t even notice that it’s running locally and not deployed to the cloud. You can run your app\neither from your IDE (VS Code/IntelliJ-based IDEs) using the mirrord extension, or from the command line, with\nmirrord exec [mirrord-options …] <YOUR-APP> [-- app-args …]. You can iterate through changes in your application,\nrerunning it easily after each little change, and even set breakpoints in your IDE and debug your application,\nwhile it is communicating as if it is running in your cluster.Why is it called “targetless”? #“Targetless” is a new mode for mirrord, which up until now always had to have a target to operate. In the normal\nmode of operation of mirrord, you specify a target container on your cluster (you can specify it by the pod or\neven the deployment, you do not have to know the specific container name). mirrord then spawns an\nagent on the same node as the target, which helps\nyour local program impersonate that container - mirror or steal its incoming traffic, send out network requests\nover it, access the same filesystem and read its environment variables.The main use case for this mode is to debug a new version of an existing application. For example, if you are\nmaking changes to an API endpoint of an existing microservice, you can run the changed version with mirrord, with\nthe existing microservice running in the cloud as a target, and when that service receives requests, they will be\nmirrored (or redirected entirely) to your local application by mirrord. This lets you debug the changed endpoint\nusing traffic from the Kubernetes cluster without deploying a new version after every little change.Can’t I just use kubectl port-forward? #There are some basic tasks that can be achieved with either mirrord or kubectl port-forward in varying degrees of\ncomfort. However, mirrord does something fundamentally different from port-forwarding. mirrord runs an application\nand forwards to the cluster whatever connections it initiates. This means you don’t need to know the ports in\nadvance and configure them before running the application, DNS is resolved in the cluster, UDP is forwarded as well\nas TCP, and connections can also be made to addresses outside the cluster (with the source address of the\ncluster, so if an external service is only open to the cluster’s IP, the application can access it with mirrord).I want to start using it right now! #Look at you, trying out new things, learning every day. Good for you.\nInstalling the mirrord CLI tool is as easy as runningorOr you can install it as a VS Code extension or a\nplugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs.Of course, as mirrord is completely open source you can also\nbuild it from source.Check out the mirrord docs, especially the\nmirrord configuration docs, and the target reference for\nhow to run targetless.\nReach out to us on Discord or GitHub\nfor help, questions, feedback or just to say hi.We used the manifests from Red Hat Developer’s\nKafka in Kubernetes tutorial\nto quickly set up the cluster. ↩︎Share postsign up to our blog post for updates and newsThis field cannot be left blank.Tal ZwickSoftware Engineer @ MetalBear.Share postYou may also like...Approaches in Cloud Development ErgonomicsOctober 31, 2022 by Eyal Bukchin	2023-06-06	{"title":"Easy K8S Connectivity for Local Utils","article":"## Easy K8S Connectivity for Local Utils\\n\\nAre you tired of containerizing and deploying your applications to Kubernetes just to test or debug them?

As demand for computation grows, it has become critical for these algorithms to be as performant as possible. Whereas remarkable progress has been achieved in the past2, making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library3. This change to this part of the sort library represents the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We also present results in extra domains, showcasing the generality of the approach. MainHuman intuition and know-how have been crucial in improving algorithms. However, many algorithms have reached a stage whereby human experts have not been able to optimize them further, leading to an ever-growing computational bottleneck. The work in classical program synthesis literature, spanning many decades, aims to generate correct programs and/or optimize programs using proxies for latency. These include enumerative search techniques4,5,6,7 and stochastic search5,6,8,9,10 as well as the more recent trend of using deep learning in program synthesis for generating correct programs11,12,13,14,15,16. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we can take this a step further by generating correct and performant algorithms by optimizing for actual measured latency at the CPU instruction level, by more efficiently searching and considering the space of correct and fast programs compared to previous work.One of the fundamental questions in computer science is how to sort a sequence17,18,19,20. This is taught in elementary computer science classes around the world21,22 and is used ubiquitously by a vast range of applications23,24,25. Decades of computer science research have focused on discovering and optimizing sorting algorithms26,27,28. A key component of practical solutions is a small sort over a short sequence of elements; this algorithm is called repeatedly when sorting large arrays that use divide-and-conquer approaches29. In this work, we focus on two types of small sort algorithm: (1) the fixed sort and (2) the variable sort. Fixed sort algorithms sort sequences of a fixed length (for example, sort 3 can only sort sequences of length 3), whereas variable sort algorithms can sort a sequence of varying size (for example, variable sort 5 can sort sequences ranging from one to five elements).We formulate the problem of discovering new, efficient sorting algorithms as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. In this game, the player selects a series of low-level CPU instructions, which we refer to as assembly instructions30, to combine to yield a new and efficient sorting algorithm. This is challenging as the player needs to consider the combinatorial space of assembly instructions to yield an algorithm that is both provably correct and fast. The hardness of the AssemblyGame arises not only from the size of the search space, which is similar to extremely challenging games such as chess (10120 games)31 and Go (10700 games)32, but also from the nature of the reward function. A single incorrect instruction in the AssemblyGame can potentially invalidate the entire algorithm, making exploration in this space of games incredibly challenging.To play the game, we introduce AlphaDev, a learning agent that is trained to search for correct and efficient algorithms. This agent is comprised of two core components, namely (1) a learning algorithm and (2) a representation function. The AlphaDev learning algorithm can incorporate both DRL as well as stochastic search optimization algorithms to play AssemblyGame. The primary learning algorithm in AlphaDev is an extension of AlphaZero33, a well-known DRL algorithm, in which a neural network is trained to guide a search to solve AssemblyGame. The representation function is interchangeable and captures the underlying structure of assembly programs. The primary AlphaDev representation is based on Transformers34.Using AlphaDev, we have discovered fixed and variable sort algorithms from scratch that are both new and more efficient than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks. The fixed sort solutions for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 discovered by AlphaDev have been integrated into the standard sort function in the LLVM standard C++ library3. This library is used by several million users including universities and numerous international companies35. In addition, we analyse the new algorithm discoveries, compare AlphaDev to stochastic search optimization approaches and apply AlphaDev to further domains to showcase the generality of the approach.Representing algorithms as low-level CPU instructionsWhen compiling algorithms to machine code from a high level language such as C++ (for example, the sorting function in Fig. 1a), the algorithm is first compiled into assembly (Fig. 1b). The assembler then converts the assembly program into executable machine code. In this work, we optimize algorithms at the assembly level30. In a typical assembly program, the values are copied from memory into registers, manipulated between registers and then written back to memory. The set of assembly instructions supported depends on the processor architecture. For the purposes of this work, we focus on a subset of assembly instructions supported by the x86 processor architecture using the AT&T syntax36. Each instruction is of the format Opcode⟨OperandA, OperandB⟩. An example instruction is mov, which is defined as move a value from source (A) to destination (B). Further instruction definitions such as compare (cmp), conditional move (cmovX) and jump (jX) can be found in Extended Data Table 1. In the example in Fig. 1b, %eax, %ecx, %edx, %edi correspond to four different register locations and (%rsi), 4(%rsi) correspond to two different memory locations. The symbol $2 is a placeholder for a constant value, which corresponds to the length of the vector in this example. We use the terms assembly program and assembly algorithm interchangeably in this work. This is because AlphaDev builds an assembly program from scratch, from an initially unordered set of instructions, each time it plays AssemblyGame, defining a new and efficient algorithm.Fig. 1: The relationship between C++ and assembly programs.a, A C++ implementation of a variable sort 2 function that sorts any input sequence of up to two elements. b, The C++ implementation in a is compiled to this equivalent low-level assembly representation.Full size imageDRL for discovering faster algorithmsIn this section, we formulate optimizing algorithms at the CPU instruction level as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem37, in which the environment is modelled as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. Each state in this game is defined as a vector St = ⟨Pt, Zt⟩ where Pt is a representation of the algorithm generated thus far in the game and Zt represents the state of memory and registers after executing the current algorithm on a set of predefined inputs. As seen in Fig. 2a, at timestep t, the player receives the current state St and executes an action at. This involves appending a legal assembly instruction (for example, mov<A,B>) to the current algorithm generated thus far. A reward rtis received that comprises both a measure of algorithm correctness and latency. Algorithm correctness (Fig. 2b) involves inputting a set of N test sequences into the current algorithm Pt to generate N outputs. These outputs are then compared to the expected outputs and a correctness reward rt is computed. Latency rewards can be generated by either (1) penalizing the agent for increasing the length of the algorithm (when length and latency are highly correlated) that we refer to as the algorithm length reward, or (2) measuring the actual latency of the algorithm. The game is executed for a limited number of steps, after which the game is terminated. Winning the game corresponds to generating a correct, low-latency algorithm using assembly instructions. Losing the game corresponds to generating an incorrect algorithm or a correct but inefficient algorithm.Fig. 2: The AssemblyGame and algorithm correctness computation.a, The AssemblyGame is played by AlphaDev, which receives as input the current assembly algorithm generated thus far St and plays the game by selecting an action to execute. In this example, the action is a mov<Register0,Memory1> assembly instruction, which is appended to the current algorithm. The agent receives a reward that is a function of the algorithm’s correctness, discussed in b, as well as the algorithm’s latency. The game is won by the player discovering a low latency, correct algorithm. b, The program correctness and latency computations are used to compute the reward rt. In this example, test sequences are input to the algorithm; for example, in the case of sorting three elements, test inputs comprise all sequences of unsorted elements of length 3. For each sequence, the algorithm output is compared to the expected output (in the case of sorting, the expected output is the sorted elements). In this example, the output \\({\\bf{D}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) does not match the expected output \\({\\bf{B}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) and the algorithm is therefore incorrect.Full size imageWe refer to the agent that plays this single-player game as AlphaDev. The agent’s primary learning algorithm is an extension of the AlphaZero agent32 and guides a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) planning procedure using a deep neural network33,38. The input to the neural network is the state St and the output is a policy and value prediction. The policy prediction is a distribution over actions and the value function is a prediction of the cumulative returns R that the agent should expect to receive from the current state St. During a game, the agent receives as input the current state St. The agent then executes an MCTS procedure and uses this to select the next action to take. The generated games are then used to update the network’s parameters, enabling the agent to learn.It is critical that AlphaDev has a representation39,40 capable of representing complex algorithmic structures to efficiently explore the space of instructions. To achieve this, we introduce the AlphaDev representation network (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This network comprises two components, namely (1) a transformer encoder network that provides the agent with a representation of the algorithm structure, and (2) the CPU state encoder network that helps the agent predict how the algorithm affects the dynamics of memory and registers. The CPU state encoder network comprises a multilayer perceptron that receives as input the state of each register and memory location for a given set of inputs. These networks each output embeddings that are combined to yield the AlphaDev state representation.Transformer encoderTransformers are natural text encoders and have had much success with language models recently14,34,41. As such, this motivated us to adapt the standard transformer to model assembly instructions. We developed and incorporated a transformer encoder, our adaptation of the MultiQuery transformer encoder42, into the AlphaDev representation network to represent the assembly instructions. Each assembly instruction’s Opcode and corresponding Operands are converted to one-hot encodings and concatenated to form the raw input sequence. This is fed through a multilayer transformer encoder, which maps it to corresponding embedding vectors (see Extended Data Fig. 1b for an illustration).Latency value functionsLatency is an important reward signal that is used to guide the agent in discovering performant algorithms. To better estimate latency, we implemented a dual value function setup, whereby AlphaDev has two value function heads: one predicting algorithm correctness and the second predicting algorithm latency. The latency head is used to directly predict the latency of a given program by using the program’s actual computed latency as a Monte Carlo target for AlphaDev during training. This dual-head approach achieved substantially better results than the vanilla, single head value function setup when optimizing for real latency.ResultsDiscovering faster sort algorithmsWe trained the AlphaDev agent from scratch to generate a range of fixed sort and variable sort algorithms that are both correct and achieve lower latency than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks.Fixed sorting algorithmsWe considered three fundamental algorithms: sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The state-of-the-art human benchmarks for these algorithms are sorting networks43 as they generate efficient, conditional branchless assembly code. This means that all instructions are executed sequentially and there is no branching involved. Improving on these algorithms is challenging as they are already highly optimized. As seen in Table 1a, AlphaDev is able to find algorithms with fewer instructions than the human benchmarks for sort 3 and sort 5 and matches the state-of-the-art performance on sort 4. These shorter algorithms do indeed lead to lower latency as the algorithm length and latency are correlated for the conditional branchless case; see Appendix B in Supplementary Information for more details. We also explored scaling to slightly larger sorts using a variant of AlphaDev. We managed to save three instructions on sort 6, two instructions on sort 7 and one instruction on sort 8, which provides a promising basis for future work. See Appendix C in Supplementary Information for an overview of the approach.Table 1 AlphaDev performance when optimizing for algorithm length and latencyFull size tableVariable sorting algorithmsWe considered three variable sorting algorithms: VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5. The human benchmark in each case is defined as an algorithm that, for a given input length, calls the corresponding sorting network. In this case, branching is required, which greatly increases the complexity of the problem as the agent needs to (1) determine how many subalgorithms it needs to construct and (2) build the body of the main algorithm in parallel. The agent may also need to call subalgorithms from other subalgorithms. In this case, optimizing for length leads to significantly shorter algorithms compared to the human benchmarks as seen in Table 1a. However, owing to the complexities introduced by branching, latency and length are not always correlated; see Supplementary Information for more details. As such, we implemented a procedure that measures the actual latency of the programs by taking the fifth percentile of latency measurements across 100 different machines, with computed confidence intervals44, and optimize this metric. See Methods for the full benchmarking setup. When optimizing for latency, the agent improves significantly on the human benchmarks in each case as seen in Table 1b.New algorithm discoveriesThe solutions discovered by AlphaDev include new and exciting algorithmic discoveries that lead to more efficient performance. In the fixed sort setting, we found that AlphaDev discovered two interesting sequences of instructions that, when applied to a sorting network algorithm, reduce the algorithm by one assembly instruction each time. We refer to each sequence of instructions as (1) the AlphaDev swap move and (2) the AlphaDev copy move respectively.AlphaDev swap moveFigure 3a presents an optimal sorting network for three elements (see Methods for an overview of sorting networks). We will explain how AlphaDev has improved the circled network segment. There are many variants of this structure that are found in sorting networks of various sizes, and the same argument applies in each case. The circled part of the network (last two comparators) can be seen as a sequence of instructions that takes an input sequence ⟨A, B, C⟩ and transforms each input as shown in Table 2a (left). However, a comparator on wires B and C precedes this operator and therefore input sequences where B ≤ C are guaranteed. This means that it is enough to compute min(A, B) as the first output instead of min(A, B, C) as shown in Table 2a (right). The pseudocode difference between Fig. 3b,c demonstrates how the AlphaDev swap move saves one instruction each time it is applied.Fig. 3: Sorting networks and algorithmic improvements discovered by AlphaDev.a, An optimal classic sorting network for three inputs. The circled comparators have been improved by AlphaDev. See the AlphaDev swap move for more details. b,c, The assembly pseudocode before applying the AlphaDev swap move (b) and after applying the AlphaDev swap move (c), resulting in the removal of a single instruction. d, An optimal classic sorting network comparator configuration that has been improved by AlphaDev.

This configuration is found in a sort 8 sorting network and corresponds to an operator taking four inputs ⟨A, B, C, D⟩ and transforming them into four outputs as seen in Table 2b (on the left). One can show that as part of sort 8, the input that flows into the operator satisfies the following inequality: \\({\\rm{D}}\\ge \\min ({\\rm{A}},{\\rm{C}})\\). This means that the operator can be improved by applying the AlphaDev copy move that is defined in Table 2b (on the right), resulting in one instruction less than the original operator. The code difference between the original operator and the code after applying the AlphaDev copy move is visualized in Fig. 3e,f, respectively.New variable sort algorithmsThe VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev is particularly interesting. The flow diagram for the human benchmark algorithm and AlphaDev can be seen in Fig. 4a,b, respectively. The human benchmark algorithm determines the length of the input vector, and then calls the corresponding sorting network to sort the elements. The AlphaDev solution has a completely different approach as seen in Fig. 4b. If the length of the input vector is strictly greater than 2, then sort 3 is immediately called, resulting in the first three elements being sorted. If the vector is greater than three elements, then a simplified sort 4 algorithm is called that sorts the remaining unsorted elements in the input vector. It is this simplified part of the routine that yields significant gains in terms of algorithmic length and latency.Fig. 4: Fundamentally different algorithms discovered by AlphaDev.a, A flow diagram of the variable sort 4 (VarSort4) human benchmark algorithm. In this algorithm, a sequence of unsorted numbers are input into the algorithm. If the sequence length is four, three or two numbers, then the corresponding sort 4, sort 3 or sort 2 sorting network is called that sorts the resulting sequence. The result is then returned and output by the function. b, The VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev. This algorithm also receives sequences of length four, three or two numbers as input. In this case, if the length is two, then it calls the sort 2 sorting network and returns. If the length is three then it calls sort 3 to sort the first three numbers and returns. If, however, the length is greater than three, then it calls sort 3, followed by a simplified sort 4 routine that sorts the remaining unsorted number. It is this part of the routine that results in significant latency savings.Full size imageStochastic search optimization approachesIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8, adapted it to the sort setting and used it as the learning algorithm in AlphaDev. We refer to this variant as AlphaDev-S (see Methods for more details). We run this algorithm with at least the same amount of resources and wall-clock time as AlphaDev. AlphaDev-S requires a prohibitive amount of time to optimize directly for latency as latency needs to be computed after every mutation. As such, AlphaDev-S optimizes for a latency proxy, namely algorithm length and, then, at the end of training, we search through all correct programs generated by AlphaDev-S and benchmark each one to find the lowest latency solution. In general, we find that AlphaDev consistently outperforms AlphaDev-S when learning from scratch without previous knowledge. In addition, as the size of the program increases, AlphaDev explores orders of magnitude fewer programs (12 million programs in the worst case) compared to AlphaDev-S (31 trillion programs in the worst case). This may be because AlphaDev is able to better explore the space of algorithms compared to the breadth-first stochastic search procedure that gets stuck more easily into local optima; see Methods for an overview of this exploration hypothesis. In addition, AlphaDev never evaluates latency during search as it uses the latency value function predictions and, because of this, only needs to compute actual measured latency on less than 0.002% of generated programs. When incorporating previous knowledge into AlphaDev-S, such as warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal solution, AlphaDev-S is more computationally efficient for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 (branchless assembly algorithms) and also generates competitive low-latency algorithms to that of AlphaDev in each case. However, for algorithms that require branching (if–else statements), in which algorithm length and latency are not well correlated, AlphaDev discovers lower latency solutions than AlphaDev-S, even when warm starting this algorithm with a near-optimal solution. See Methods for an in-depth analysis of these algorithms.Generalization to additional domainsTo test the generality of AlphaDev, we train the agent on a set of additional domains. These include a protocol buffer deserialization subroutine called VarInt, presented below, and a competitive coding problem (see Appendix D in Supplementary Information for more details). The competitive coding domain latency performance is reported in Table 1b.Protocol Buffer is Google’s open-source data format used to serialize structured data45. This format is commonly used in cases in which performance or network load is of primary concern. The VarInt algorithm46 is a key component in both the serialization and deserialization processes. We trained the AlphaDev agent as in variable sort to optimize the VarInt deserialization function with respect to correctness and measured latency. For correctness, we reward the agent for correctly deserializing each input. We use a set of 80 inputs and corresponding outputs that cover common protobuf use cases. AlphaDev learns an optimized VarInt deserialization function and manages to significantly outperform the human benchmark for single valued inputs. Our agent discovers a branchless solution that is both shorter (Table 1a) and roughly three times faster than the human benchmark (Table 1b). In doing so, the agent also discovered a new VarInt assignment move in which AlphaDev learns to combine two operations into a single instruction leading to latency savings. See Appendix D.1 in Supplementary Information for a full overview of this move. This is a strong indication that AlphaDev is capable of generalizing to optimize non-trivial, real-world algorithms.Libc++ sort patchThe sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library are called many times by larger sorting algorithms and are therefore fundamental components of the library. We reverse engineered the low-level assembly sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 to C++ and discovered that our sort implementations led to improvements of up to 70% for sequences of a length of five and roughly 1.7% for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements. These improvements are for the uint32, uint64 and float data types for ARMv8, Intel Skylake and AMD Zen 2 CPU architectures; see Appendix E in Supplementary Information for the full performance tables. The performance improvements are due to both the branchless conditional assembly generated by AlphaDev as well as the new AlphaDev swap move. For sort 5, we used a 43 length algorithm discovered by AlphaDev, as it led to a more efficient C++ implementation. These algorithms were sent for review and have officially been included in the libc++ standard sorting library3. It is the first change to these sub-routines in over a decade. This is also the first time that any component in this sort library has been replaced by an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We estimate that these routines are being called trillions of times every day1,35,47.DiscussionAlphaDev discovers new, state-of-the-art sorting algorithms from scratch that have been incorporated into the LLVM C++ library, used by millions of developers and applications around the world23,24,25. Both AlphaDev and stochastic search are powerful algorithms. An interesting direction for future research is to investigate combining these algorithms together to realize the complementary advantages of both approaches.It is important to note that AlphaDev can, in theory, generalize to functions that do not require exhaustive verification of test cases. For example, hashing functions48 as well as cryptographic hashing functions49 define function correctness by the number of hashing collisions. Therefore, in this case, AlphaDev can optimize for minimizing collisions as well as latency. AlphaDev can also, in theory, optimize complicated logic components within the body of large, impressive functions. We hope that AlphaDev can provide interesting insights and inspire new approaches in both the artificial intelligence and program synthesis communities.MethodsBackgroundAlphaZeroAlphaZero33 is an RL algorithm that leverages MCTS as a policy improvement operator. It consists of (1) a representation network frep that outputs a latent representation ht of the state St; and (2) a prediction network fpred that predicts the expected return (the value) \\({\\hat{v}}_{t}\\) and a policy (that is, distribution over the action space) \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) from a given latent state. The algorithm uses the true dynamics and reward when planning. MuZero38 is a model-based variant of AlphaZero that has the same representation and prediction networks, but also learns a model of the dynamics and predicts rewards, which it uses for planning. Specifically, it learns a dynamics network fdyn that predicts the next latent state \\({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) and reward \\({\\hat{r}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) resulting from a transition. Note that the subscript t denotes timesteps in the real environment and the superscript k represents timesteps in the model.$${{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}={f}^{rep}({{\\bf{\\text{S}}}}_{t})$$ (1) $${{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k+1},\\,{\\hat{r}}_{t}^{k+1}={f}^{dyn}({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k},{{\\bf{\\text{a}}}}_{t}^{k})$$ (2) $${\\hat{v}}_{t},\\,{\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}={f}^{pred}({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t})$$ (3) On reaching a new state, AlphaZero proceeds by first encoding the state into a latent representation with the representation network. Then, the true dynamics or dynamics network (for MuZero) as well as the prediction network fpred(ht) are used to simulate several trajectories that fill out a search tree, by sampling state transitions. At each node, the actions are selected using an optimistic strategy called the predictor upper confidence tree bound32, meant to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (progressing further down the subtree of the current estimate of the best action). This strategy starts out by following the predicted policy \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) closely, and gradually shifts towards maximizing the predicted value function. Ultimately, an action is recommended by sampling from the root node with probability proportional to its visit count during MCTS. The predicted policy is then trained to match the visit counts of the MCTS policy in an attempt to distil the search procedure into a policy such that subsequent iterations of MCTS will disregard nodes that are not promising.Sorting networksSorting networks are very efficient as their structures can be parallelized on modern CPU architectures. They therefore tend to achieve faster runtime performance, especially on small sorts, compared to popular and efficient base case algorithms such as insertion sort17,43,50. A sorting network43 consists of two types of item called comparators (vertical lines) and wires (horizontal lines) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Each wire carries a value from left to right. When two wires intersect at a comparator, the values on the two wires are compared. If the value of the bottom wire is smaller than the value of the top wire, then the values are swapped between wires as seen in Extended Data Fig. 2b. A programmatic implementation of a sorting network consists of executing these swaps on particular pairs of elements from the input sequence in a particular order.Action pruning rulesWe pruned the action space by removing some program invariances (for example, the order of register allocation) and illegal instructions (for example, comparing two memory locations). This helps reducing the size of the action space and increases convergence rate. For our experiments, we used the following rules: (1) Memory locations are always read in incremental order. (2) Registers are allocated in incremental order. (3) We cannot compare or conditionally move to a memory location (illegal). (4) We can read and write to each memory location only once. (5) We cannot use non-initialized registers (illegal). (6) Do not perform consecutive compare instructions. Training regimeWe train AlphaDev on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v.3, with a total batch size of 1,024 per TPU core. We use up to 16 TPU cores and train for 1 million iterations. On the actor side, the games are played on standalone TPU v.4, and we use up to 512 actors. In practice, across all tasks, training takes, in the worst case, 2 days to converge.AlphaDev-SIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other possible approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8 and incorporated it into AlphaDev as the learning algorithm to optimize sorting functions. We refer to this adapted version as AlphaDev-S. Our re-implementation has been specifically optimized for the sorting domain. This includes implementing the algorithm to run with our assembly environment, defining a correctness and performance loss function specific to sorting and running extensive hyperparameter sweeps to identify the best variant. The cost function used for AlphaDev-S is c = correctness + α × performance where correctness corresponds to computing the number of incorrect input sequence elements that are still unsorted, performance corresponds to the algorithm length reward and α is a weight trading off the two cost functions. We are unable to optimize directly for latency as this slows down the learning algorithm considerably making learning infeasible. It should be noted that this function has been adapted to support the same set of assembly instructions used by AlphaDev as well as prune the same set of incorrect or illegal actions. It also uses the same program correctness computation module (Fig. 2b) to compute the correctness term.AlphaDev-S is then executed by first proposing a transformation to the program stored in the buffer (which may be empty or initialized with an already sorted program). The correctness and performance terms are then computed using the program correctness module and algorithm length, respectively. If the cost is lower than the current best cost, the new program is accepted with high probability, otherwise it is rejected. We will now discuss the correctness cost function and transform weights in more detail.Correctness costFor the correctness cost function, we implemented three types of cost function. The first one is defined as the percentage of incorrectly placed items: \\(\\frac{P-P{C}_{t}}{P}\\) where P is the total number of items to place and PCt is number of correctly placed items at timestep t. The second variant is the square root of this equation. The final cost function takes the square root of the difference \\(\\sqrt{-{PC}_{t}}\\) and this is what yielded the best performance.Program transformationsWe enabled several program transformations such as adding an instruction to increase the size of the program (Add Transform), swapping two instructions (Swap Transform), randomly changing an Opcode for an instruction (Opcode Transform), randomly sampling an Operand for a chosen instruction (Operand Transform) and randomly sample an Opcode and its corresponding Operands (Instruction Transform). It is possible to influence the sampling of these transforms to encourage some to be sampled more or less frequently. We optimized the weights for sampling transforms by running an extensive hyperparameter sweep.Investigative studies for AlphaDev variantsWe now present a set of investigative studies that help to better understand the advantages and limitations of the DRL and the stochastic search learning algorithms used in AlphaDev. We compare AlphaDev to AlphaDev-S. We implemented two variants of AlphaDev-S: (1) Cold Start (AlphaDev-S-CS) and (2) Warm Start (AlphaDev-S-WS). AlphaDev-S-CS uses no previous information and has to generate a program from an empty program buffer. AlphaDev-S-WS’s buffer is warm started with a correct sorting program (for example, optimal sorting network assembly program) and it edits the program to optimize it further. We compared the variants with AlphaDev in both the individual and variable sort algorithm setups.Because AlphaDev always learns from scratch with no previous knowledge, the direct comparison would be to the cold start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-CS. However, as initial near-optimal programs may sometimes be available, we also compare AlphaDev to the warm start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-WS.It should be noted that the stochastic search variants are unable to optimize directly for latency, as this would make learning infeasible because of computational efficiency. As such, our AlphaDev-S variants optimize for algorithm length. Then, at the end of training, we iterate through the set of generated programs for AlphaDev-S across varying lengths and identify the program with the lowest latency.In each case, the stochastic search algorithms (AlphaDev-S) are run using at least the same computational resources and wall-clock time to that of AlphaDev.Fixed sortWe first examine the performance of the various approaches for the fixed sort algorithms. In this case, all algorithmic variants optimize for algorithm length as algorithm length and latency are highly correlated in the conditional branchless setting (see Supplementary Information for more details).In the cold start setting, AlphaDev-S-CS is unable to find the optimal programs in each case as seen in Extended Data Table 2a. In addition, AlphaDev-S-CS explores orders of magnitude more programs than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. In the warm start setting, AlphaDev-S is warm started with a near-optimal sorted program, and is able to match the performance of AlphaDev in each case as shown in Extended Data Table 2a. It is more computationally efficient than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2c but explores orders of magnitude more programs for sort 3 and sort 5 as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. It can be argued that AlphaDev-S-WS has a substantial advantage in this scenario as it is provided with an initial near-optimal program. We will show in the Variable sort section that when the algorithms become more complicated and branching is introduced, warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal program is not enough and can cause it to get stuck in suboptimal solutions.Brute-force approachWe also used a brute-force approach to prove that no program shorter than 17 instructions exists for sort 3. We had to enumerate roughly 1032 programs and, even with pruning heuristics, it took more than 3 days to prove this hypothesis. For sort 4 and above this approach is infeasible.Latency benchmarking suiteThe length of a program is only a proxy for the performance of an algorithm. As we introduce branching structures, the length and latency of a program are not well correlated. Therefore, we run the programs on actual machines and measure their latency. Microbenchmarking is very challenging given the numerous noise sources that could affect the measurements. This is especially true when running on shared machines where there could be interference from other processes. Our approach is to have a separate benchmarking service, replicated on separated machines, so that we can quickly perform many measurements in a controlled environment under different conditions. The system works as follows: (1) The RL agent processes 1,000 measurements across the machines using the replicated service. (2) For each measurement, the service runs the given sorting algorithm over 10,000 random inputs (for example, for sort 3 this would be 3 × 10,000 = 30,000 random integers). (3) We measure the time taken using a CPU performance counter (CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.CORE). We then take the fifth percentile as our final measurement, because we assume that most noise sources are one-sided (for example, cache misses, pre-emptions and so on). During training we process the measurements across ten machines for computational efficiency. After training, we benchmark AlphaDev’s solution against the baseline solutions, and process the measurements across 100 machines for more accuracy and noise reduction. For each benchmark, we compute confidence intervals using the distribution-free two-sided confidence interval for a quantile tabular method44.Variable sortWhen optimizing directly for latency, AlphaDev outperforms AlphaDev-S-WS on VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5 as seen in Extended Data Table 3a. AlphaDev-S-CS fails to find a solution in each case. In the cases of VarSort4 and VarSort5, program length and latency are not correlated (see Supplementary Information for more details). This indicates that when program length cannot be used as a proxy for performance, AlphaDev is able to find lower latency solutions compared to AlphaDev-S. This is even in the case where the stochastic search is warm started with a near-optimal program. In addition, AlphaDev converges to the optimal solution after exploring a maximum of 12M programs as seen in Extended Data Table 3b. This is orders of magnitude lower than that of AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively (31 trillion programs in the worst case).Exploration hypothesisWe proposed that AlphaDev-S struggles to discover programs when learning from scratch and gets stuck in local optima when warm started because of its limited exploration capabilities as a result of the stochastic search procedure. Extended Data Fig. 3 shows two-dimensional t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) projections51 of AlphaDev and AlphaDev-S’s assembly algorithms discovered during their respective training procedures for VarSort5. The features used in the projection include correctness, latency, algorithm length and a histogram count of the instructions used per algorithm. Extended Data Fig. 3a indicates the regions in algorithm space explored by AlphaDev, AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively, whereas Extended Data Fig. 3b superimposes algorithm correctness onto each point in the t-SNE projection in which the colour indicates the correctness of each discovered algorithm, ranging from incorrect algorithms (purple) to correct algorithms (yellow). The AlphaDev-S variants both cover a densely packed circular region around their initial seed, which highlights the breadth-first nature of their stochastic search procedure. This illustrates that AlphaDev-S-CS fails to navigate through the space of incorrect algorithms in a reasonable amount of time and discover correct algorithms when learning from scratch. A similar argument applies to AlphaDev-S-WS whereby, when optimizing from an already correct but suboptimal expert demonstration, the algorithm is biased towards exploring its vicinity and struggles to escape this local maxima. By contrast, AlphaDev has more diverse algorithm space coverage, as the long-term value function is a guiding signal for discovering new and interesting parts of algorithm space. As seen in Extended Data Fig. 3b, it is capable of escaping the space of incorrect algorithms to discover a new space of correct algorithms, highlighting the exploration advantages afforded by AlphaDev.Related workAssembly optimizationThere are numerous approaches to optimizing assembly programs, which we have classified into three groups: enumerative search, stochastic search and symbolic search5.First, enumerative search techniques include brute-force program enumeration4,5,6 as well as implicit enumeration using symbolic theorem proving52,53. These approaches search through the space of programs to find a solution based on a predefined set of programs, heuristic and/or cost function. These approaches struggle to span large regions of program space, especially as the size and complexity of the program increases.Second, stochastic search techniques circumvent comprehensive enumeration by relying on sampling mechanisms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling5,6,8,9. Rajeev Alur et al.5 define a correctness specification, provided by a logical formula that uses symbols from a background theory. The goal is to then find an implementation expression such that logical formula defining the specification is valid. The idea is to iteratively add test cases and then search and expand the program to solve the given test cases. They optimize for correctness on problems from the book Hacker’s delight54. Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana et al.6 introduce the LENS algorithm that is based on running enumerative, stochastic and symbolic search in parallel, while relying on handcrafted pruning rules. This setup is capable of optimizing up to 21 instructions, and cannot optimize for latency nor support branching. Another algorithm8 is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo rejection sampling and applies transformations to programs in assembly using a loss function that is a function of correctness and performance. Many of these approaches are prone to getting stuck in local minima and may also struggle as the size and/or complexity of the program increases. In addition, incorporating actual, measured latency into these approaches are either infeasible or prohibitively expensive.Third, symbolic search approaches can also be implemented to optimize assembly programs. These include SAT solvers55, SMT solvers5,6 and Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs)56,57. However, these approaches suffer from scaling issues. For example, classical solvers require a problem to be translated into a certain canonical form. It usually requires an expert in the said solvers and a substantial amount of time to find an efficient formulation. In addition, for any new modification of the problem, this has to be repeated. Classical solvers are also hard to parallelize and thus, it is challenging to leverage more hardware to speed up the solving process. Another symbolic search algorithm is Cholorphyll10 that implements a multi-phase approach. It first requires as input a source program with partition annotations that specify where code and data reside. Then, a layout synthesizer maps program fragments onto physical cores to minimize computational costs. The code is then separated into per-core program fragments and the program fragments are compiled into machine code. At this point, a superoptimizer optimizes each of these fragments.SIMD optimizationVarious approaches58,59,60 have also been applied to sorting functions that run in the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)61 setup. This setup is capable of parallelizing instruction execution, but is not supported at present in popular libraries such as LLVM’s libc++ std::sort library. One example is that from Gilles Barthe et al.7 that proposes a methodology for optimizing programs by automatically vectorizing loops with SIMD instructions. They do this by introducing a framework for verifying the correctness of transformations to a program and performing a search-based procedure using the said transformation. Their framework can discover SIMD looping structures of up to nine instructions in 0.12 s, which corresponds to a minimum 2× speed-up.RL approaches for program synthesisThere are also several studies using RL for program optimization. Kevin Ellis et al.62 learn a policy and value function to write and evaluate code, as well as performing a Monte Carlo-style search strategy during inference. This work requires a pretraining step and aims to generate correct programs that satisfy a predefined specification. The approach is successfully applied to computer-aided design and string editing programs. SuperSonic63 uses an RL meta-optimizer to select between different RL architectures, using a Multi-Armed Bandit policy search to find a state representation, reward function and RL algorithm that is optimal for the current task. This requires keeping track of many RL algorithms and architectures, which are used as part of the state space. By contrast, our approach only focuses on training a single RL architecture, taking advantage of MCTS search and powerful state representations. Shypula et al.64 create a supervised assembly dataset and use it to train a Transformer model for mapping unoptimized to optimized code, followed by an RL stage for improving the solution quality. Our method does not require a supervised dataset or two separate training and finetuning stages, and optimizes everything end-to-end using RL and search instead. Chen et al.65 define their own domain specific language and perform input–output program synthesis that better uses the intermediate program representation to guide the synthesis routine. They show that this can be incorporated with RL, using the setup of Rudy Bunel et al.66 and improve the correctness of generated functions. They do not, however, optimize for program length or latency.Input–output examples for program synthesisA large body of work addresses the problem of learning programs from input–output pairs. One type of approach learns a neural network for matching inputs to outputs directly11,13,67,68. This approach is difficult to integrate into existing libraries and can struggle to generalize to previously unseen inputs, although there has been some encouraging recent progress using graph representations69. Another type of approach is to perform a search in program space, guided by a learned model12,70,71,72. For instance, Chen et al.70 use a model that predicts the next program token on the basis of a partial program and the input–output pairs. This bears some similarities to how search is guided in our approach: the learned policy prior in AlphaZero is a model for predicting the next token, learned on the basis of a combination of a partial program and that program’s effects on the inputs. However, we are interested in finding correct and efficient programs, which we achieve by further learning a value function for approximating the expected latency of partial programs, and using AlphaZero to incorporate this value function into the search process.Deep learning for code generationThere are also several deep learning approaches that use large languages models to generate code. These approaches vary in their uses from transpilation, code refactoring and explaining code15 to generating human-level competitive code using a natural language description14. That particular work aims to generate correct code, but does not focus on generating low-latency solutions.Sort-based program optimizationThere are several program synthesis studies that have tackled sorting algorithms. For example, White et al.26 use RL for learning sorting functions. Their work uses several heuristics and a domain specific language to yield a sorting algorithm called reinforcement programming sort. Srivastava et al.27 encodes the program synthesis as a verification problem. Specifically, they represent a synthesis task as a tuple consisting of the functional expression, the domains and guards appearing in the synthesized program and the resource constraints. The idea is that, given a prespecified resource constraint, their synthesizer produces a program that meets the predefined specification to ensure correctness. They apply this to discover merge sort and quick sort. Jason Ansel et al.28 takes as input predefined algorithms (for example, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort) and then determines when to select these algorithms for execution using its autotuner function. It does so by defining a language that contains rules and transforms that dictate how the algorithms are selected and where they are executed. Data availability The data used to train the system were generated synthetically according to the procedures explained in the paper. The algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for the copy and swap operators are presented in the main paper. We have also released the discovered AlphaDev assembly implementations for sort 3–8 as well as VarSort3, 4 and 5 on Github at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev. We have included exhaustive tests to ensure that each implementation is correct. In addition, Appendix G in Supplementary Information contains a list of additional, correct sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The performance of the sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms on the official LLVM benchmarking suite for three different CPU architectures as well as floats, int32 and int64 data types is detailed in Appendix E in the Supplementary Information. In addition, the AlphaDev sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 implementations can be found in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library3. Code availability We have also released pseudocode at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev that includes the environment, the full actor and training loops as well as the core MCTS algorithm. In addition, we include our actual JAX implementation of our policy, value and representation networks that enable the architectures to be reproduced. Finally, we have a config file containing the hyperparameter definitions to be used with the agent. ReferencesAmazon. Amazon S3—two trillion objects, 1.1 million requests/second.

It also contains a CPU State Encoder network that receives as input the current state of memory and registers. The exact architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the Supplementary Information, Appendix A. (b) Before inputting instructions into the Transformer Encoder network, each program instruction’s opcode and operands are converted to one-hot encodings and concatenated. The resulting encoding is then fed into the Transformer Encoder network.Extended Data Fig. 2 An example sorting network43.(a) The horizontal lines are called wires and the vertical lines are called comparators. (b) An initially unsorted sequence of values are input into the sorting network on the left hand side. At various stages two wires encounter a comparator. If the value at the top of the comparator is smaller than the value at the bottom of the comparator, the numbers switch wires. An optimal sorting network places comparators in specific positions so as to sort any sequence of unsorted values using the minimum number of comparators.Extended Data Fig. 3 Hypothesis for improved exploration using AlphaDev.(a) A 2D t-SNE51 projection indicating the regions explored by AlphaDev (blue) compared to AlphaDev-S.

As demand for computation grows, it has become critical for these algorithms to be as performant as possible. Whereas remarkable progress has been achieved in the past2, making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library3. This change to this part of the sort library represents the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We also present results in extra domains, showcasing the generality of the approach.MainHuman intuition and know-how have been crucial in improving algorithms. However, many algorithms have reached a stage whereby human experts have not been able to optimize them further, leading to an ever-growing computational bottleneck. The work in classical program synthesis literature, spanning many decades, aims to generate correct programs and/or optimize programs using proxies for latency. These include enumerative search techniques4,5,6,7 and stochastic search5,6,8,9,10 as well as the more recent trend of using deep learning in program synthesis for generating correct programs11,12,13,14,15,16. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we can take this a step further by generating correct and performant algorithms by optimizing for actual measured latency at the CPU instruction level, by more efficiently searching and considering the space of correct and fast programs compared to previous work.One of the fundamental questions in computer science is how to sort a sequence17,18,19,20. This is taught in elementary computer science classes around the world21,22 and is used ubiquitously by a vast range of applications23,24,25. Decades of computer science research have focused on discovering and optimizing sorting algorithms26,27,28. A key component of practical solutions is a small sort over a short sequence of elements; this algorithm is called repeatedly when sorting large arrays that use divide-and-conquer approaches29. In this work, we focus on two types of small sort algorithm: (1) the fixed sort and (2) the variable sort. Fixed sort algorithms sort sequences of a fixed length (for example, sort 3 can only sort sequences of length 3), whereas variable sort algorithms can sort a sequence of varying size (for example, variable sort 5 can sort sequences ranging from one to five elements).We formulate the problem of discovering new, efficient sorting algorithms as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. In this game, the player selects a series of low-level CPU instructions, which we refer to as assembly instructions30, to combine to yield a new and efficient sorting algorithm. This is challenging as the player needs to consider the combinatorial space of assembly instructions to yield an algorithm that is both provably correct and fast. The hardness of the AssemblyGame arises not only from the size of the search space, which is similar to extremely challenging games such as chess (10120 games)31 and Go (10700 games)32, but also from the nature of the reward function. A single incorrect instruction in the AssemblyGame can potentially invalidate the entire algorithm, making exploration in this space of games incredibly challenging.To play the game, we introduce AlphaDev, a learning agent that is trained to search for correct and efficient algorithms. This agent is comprised of two core components, namely (1) a learning algorithm and (2) a representation function. The AlphaDev learning algorithm can incorporate both DRL as well as stochastic search optimization algorithms to play AssemblyGame. The primary learning algorithm in AlphaDev is an extension of AlphaZero33, a well-known DRL algorithm, in which a neural network is trained to guide a search to solve AssemblyGame. The representation function is interchangeable and captures the underlying structure of assembly programs. The primary AlphaDev representation is based on Transformers34.Using AlphaDev, we have discovered fixed and variable sort algorithms from scratch that are both new and more efficient than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks. The fixed sort solutions for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 discovered by AlphaDev have been integrated into the standard sort function in the LLVM standard C++ library3. This library is used by several million users including universities and numerous international companies35. In addition, we analyse the new algorithm discoveries, compare AlphaDev to stochastic search optimization approaches and apply AlphaDev to further domains to showcase the generality of the approach.Representing algorithms as low-level CPU instructionsWhen compiling algorithms to machine code from a high level language such as C++ (for example, the sorting function in Fig. 1a), the algorithm is first compiled into assembly (Fig. 1b). The assembler then converts the assembly program into executable machine code. In this work, we optimize algorithms at the assembly level30. In a typical assembly program, the values are copied from memory into registers, manipulated between registers and then written back to memory. The set of assembly instructions supported depends on the processor architecture. For the purposes of this work, we focus on a subset of assembly instructions supported by the x86 processor architecture using the AT&T syntax36. Each instruction is of the format Opcode⟨OperandA, OperandB⟩. An example instruction is mov, which is defined as move a value from source (A) to destination (B). Further instruction definitions such as compare (cmp), conditional move (cmovX) and jump (jX) can be found in Extended Data Table 1. In the example in Fig. 1b, %eax, %ecx, %edx, %edi correspond to four different register locations and (%rsi), 4(%rsi) correspond to two different memory locations. The symbol $2 is a placeholder for a constant value, which corresponds to the length of the vector in this example. We use the terms assembly program and assembly algorithm interchangeably in this work. This is because AlphaDev builds an assembly program from scratch, from an initially unordered set of instructions, each time it plays AssemblyGame, defining a new and efficient algorithm.a, A C++ implementation of a variable sort 2 function that sorts any input sequence of up to two elements. b, The C++ implementation in a is compiled to this equivalent low-level assembly representation.DRL for discovering faster algorithmsIn this section, we formulate optimizing algorithms at the CPU instruction level as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem37, in which the environment is modelled as a single-player game that we refer to as AssemblyGame. Each state in this game is defined as a vector St = ⟨Pt, Zt⟩ where Pt is a representation of the algorithm generated thus far in the game and Zt represents the state of memory and registers after executing the current algorithm on a set of predefined inputs. As seen in Fig. 2a, at timestep t, the player receives the current state St and executes an action at. This involves appending a legal assembly instruction (for example, mov<A,B>) to the current algorithm generated thus far. A reward rtis received that comprises both a measure of algorithm correctness and latency. Algorithm correctness (Fig. 2b) involves inputting a set of N test sequences into the current algorithm Pt to generate N outputs. These outputs are then compared to the expected outputs and a correctness reward rt is computed. Latency rewards can be generated by either (1) penalizing the agent for increasing the length of the algorithm (when length and latency are highly correlated) that we refer to as the algorithm length reward, or (2) measuring the actual latency of the algorithm. The game is executed for a limited number of steps, after which the game is terminated. Winning the game corresponds to generating a correct, low-latency algorithm using assembly instructions. Losing the game corresponds to generating an incorrect algorithm or a correct but inefficient algorithm.a, The AssemblyGame is played by AlphaDev, which receives as input the current assembly algorithm generated thus far St and plays the game by selecting an action to execute. In this example, the action is a mov<Register0,Memory1> assembly instruction, which is appended to the current algorithm. The agent receives a reward that is a function of the algorithm’s correctness, discussed in b, as well as the algorithm’s latency. The game is won by the player discovering a low latency, correct algorithm. b, The program correctness and latency computations are used to compute the reward rt. In this example, test sequences are input to the algorithm; for example, in the case of sorting three elements, test inputs comprise all sequences of unsorted elements of length 3. For each sequence, the algorithm output is compared to the expected output (in the case of sorting, the expected output is the sorted elements). In this example, the output \\({\\bf{D}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) does not match the expected output \\({\\bf{B}}{\\boldsymbol{{\\prime} }}\\) and the algorithm is therefore incorrect.We refer to the agent that plays this single-player game as AlphaDev. The agent’s primary learning algorithm is an extension of the AlphaZero agent32 and guides a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) planning procedure using a deep neural network33,38. The input to the neural network is the state St and the output is a policy and value prediction. The policy prediction is a distribution over actions and the value function is a prediction of the cumulative returns R that the agent should expect to receive from the current state St. During a game, the agent receives as input the current state St. The agent then executes an MCTS procedure and uses this to select the next action to take. The generated games are then used to update the network’s parameters, enabling the agent to learn.It is critical that AlphaDev has a representation39,40 capable of representing complex algorithmic structures to efficiently explore the space of instructions. To achieve this, we introduce the AlphaDev representation network (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This network comprises two components, namely (1) a transformer encoder network that provides the agent with a representation of the algorithm structure, and (2) the CPU state encoder network that helps the agent predict how the algorithm affects the dynamics of memory and registers. The CPU state encoder network comprises a multilayer perceptron that receives as input the state of each register and memory location for a given set of inputs. These networks each output embeddings that are combined to yield the AlphaDev state representation.Transformer encoderTransformers are natural text encoders and have had much success with language models recently14,34,41. As such, this motivated us to adapt the standard transformer to model assembly instructions. We developed and incorporated a transformer encoder, our adaptation of the MultiQuery transformer encoder42, into the AlphaDev representation network to represent the assembly instructions. Each assembly instruction’s Opcode and corresponding Operands are converted to one-hot encodings and concatenated to form the raw input sequence. This is fed through a multilayer transformer encoder, which maps it to corresponding embedding vectors (see Extended Data Fig. 1b for an illustration).Latency value functionsLatency is an important reward signal that is used to guide the agent in discovering performant algorithms. To better estimate latency, we implemented a dual value function setup, whereby AlphaDev has two value function heads: one predicting algorithm correctness and the second predicting algorithm latency. The latency head is used to directly predict the latency of a given program by using the program’s actual computed latency as a Monte Carlo target for AlphaDev during training. This dual-head approach achieved substantially better results than the vanilla, single head value function setup when optimizing for real latency.ResultsDiscovering faster sort algorithmsWe trained the AlphaDev agent from scratch to generate a range of fixed sort and variable sort algorithms that are both correct and achieve lower latency than the state-of-the-art human benchmarks.Fixed sorting algorithmsWe considered three fundamental algorithms: sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The state-of-the-art human benchmarks for these algorithms are sorting networks43 as they generate efficient, conditional branchless assembly code. This means that all instructions are executed sequentially and there is no branching involved. Improving on these algorithms is challenging as they are already highly optimized. As seen in Table 1a, AlphaDev is able to find algorithms with fewer instructions than the human benchmarks for sort 3 and sort 5 and matches the state-of-the-art performance on sort 4. These shorter algorithms do indeed lead to lower latency as the algorithm length and latency are correlated for the conditional branchless case; see Appendix B in Supplementary Information for more details. We also explored scaling to slightly larger sorts using a variant of AlphaDev. We managed to save three instructions on sort 6, two instructions on sort 7 and one instruction on sort 8, which provides a promising basis for future work. See Appendix C in Supplementary Information for an overview of the approach.Variable sorting algorithmsWe considered three variable sorting algorithms: VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5. The human benchmark in each case is defined as an algorithm that, for a given input length, calls the corresponding sorting network. In this case, branching is required, which greatly increases the complexity of the problem as the agent needs to (1) determine how many subalgorithms it needs to construct and (2) build the body of the main algorithm in parallel. The agent may also need to call subalgorithms from other subalgorithms. In this case, optimizing for length leads to significantly shorter algorithms compared to the human benchmarks as seen in Table 1a. However, owing to the complexities introduced by branching, latency and length are not always correlated; see Supplementary Information for more details. As such, we implemented a procedure that measures the actual latency of the programs by taking the fifth percentile of latency measurements across 100 different machines, with computed confidence intervals44, and optimize this metric. See Methods for the full benchmarking setup. When optimizing for latency, the agent improves significantly on the human benchmarks in each case as seen in Table 1b.New algorithm discoveriesThe solutions discovered by AlphaDev include new and exciting algorithmic discoveries that lead to more efficient performance. In the fixed sort setting, we found that AlphaDev discovered two interesting sequences of instructions that, when applied to a sorting network algorithm, reduce the algorithm by one assembly instruction each time. We refer to each sequence of instructions as (1) the AlphaDev swap move and (2) the AlphaDev copy move respectively.AlphaDev swap moveFigure 3a presents an optimal sorting network for three elements (see Methods for an overview of sorting networks). We will explain how AlphaDev has improved the circled network segment. There are many variants of this structure that are found in sorting networks of various sizes, and the same argument applies in each case. The circled part of the network (last two comparators) can be seen as a sequence of instructions that takes an input sequence ⟨A, B, C⟩ and transforms each input as shown in Table 2a (left). However, a comparator on wires B and C precedes this operator and therefore input sequences where B ≤ C are guaranteed. This means that it is enough to compute min(A, B) as the first output instead of min(A, B, C) as shown in Table 2a (right). The pseudocode difference between Fig. 3b,c demonstrates how the AlphaDev swap move saves one instruction each time it is applied.a, An optimal classic sorting network for three inputs. The circled comparators have been improved by AlphaDev. See the AlphaDev swap move for more details. b,c, The assembly pseudocode before applying the AlphaDev swap move (b) and after applying the AlphaDev swap move (c), resulting in the removal of a single instruction. d, An optimal classic sorting network comparator configuration that has been improved by AlphaDev. See the AlphaDev copy move for more details. e,f, The assembly pseudocode before applying the AlphaDev copy move (e) and after applying the AlphaDev copy move (f), resulting in the removal of a single instruction.AlphaDev copy moveFigure 3d presents a sorting network configuration, consisting of three comparators, that is applied across four wires. This configuration is found in a sort 8 sorting network and corresponds to an operator taking four inputs ⟨A, B, C, D⟩ and transforming them into four outputs as seen in Table 2b (on the left). One can show that as part of sort 8, the input that flows into the operator satisfies the following inequality: \\({\\rm{D}}\\ge \\min ({\\rm{A}},{\\rm{C}})\\). This means that the operator can be improved by applying the AlphaDev copy move that is defined in Table 2b (on the right), resulting in one instruction less than the original operator. The code difference between the original operator and the code after applying the AlphaDev copy move is visualized in Fig. 3e,f, respectively.New variable sort algorithmsThe VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev is particularly interesting. The flow diagram for the human benchmark algorithm and AlphaDev can be seen in Fig. 4a,b, respectively. The human benchmark algorithm determines the length of the input vector, and then calls the corresponding sorting network to sort the elements. The AlphaDev solution has a completely different approach as seen in Fig. 4b. If the length of the input vector is strictly greater than 2, then sort 3 is immediately called, resulting in the first three elements being sorted. If the vector is greater than three elements, then a simplified sort 4 algorithm is called that sorts the remaining unsorted elements in the input vector. It is this simplified part of the routine that yields significant gains in terms of algorithmic length and latency.a, A flow diagram of the variable sort 4 (VarSort4) human benchmark algorithm. In this algorithm, a sequence of unsorted numbers are input into the algorithm. If the sequence length is four, three or two numbers, then the corresponding sort 4, sort 3 or sort 2 sorting network is called that sorts the resulting sequence. The result is then returned and output by the function. b, The VarSort4 algorithm discovered by AlphaDev. This algorithm also receives sequences of length four, three or two numbers as input. In this case, if the length is two, then it calls the sort 2 sorting network and returns. If the length is three then it calls sort 3 to sort the first three numbers and returns. If, however, the length is greater than three, then it calls sort 3, followed by a simplified sort 4 routine that sorts the remaining unsorted number. It is this part of the routine that results in significant latency savings.Stochastic search optimization approachesIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8, adapted it to the sort setting and used it as the learning algorithm in AlphaDev. We refer to this variant as AlphaDev-S (see Methods for more details). We run this algorithm with at least the same amount of resources and wall-clock time as AlphaDev. AlphaDev-S requires a prohibitive amount of time to optimize directly for latency as latency needs to be computed after every mutation. As such, AlphaDev-S optimizes for a latency proxy, namely algorithm length and, then, at the end of training, we search through all correct programs generated by AlphaDev-S and benchmark each one to find the lowest latency solution. In general, we find that AlphaDev consistently outperforms AlphaDev-S when learning from scratch without previous knowledge. In addition, as the size of the program increases, AlphaDev explores orders of magnitude fewer programs (12 million programs in the worst case) compared to AlphaDev-S (31 trillion programs in the worst case). This may be because AlphaDev is able to better explore the space of algorithms compared to the breadth-first stochastic search procedure that gets stuck more easily into local optima; see Methods for an overview of this exploration hypothesis. In addition, AlphaDev never evaluates latency during search as it uses the latency value function predictions and, because of this, only needs to compute actual measured latency on less than 0.002% of generated programs. When incorporating previous knowledge into AlphaDev-S, such as warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal solution, AlphaDev-S is more computationally efficient for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 (branchless assembly algorithms) and also generates competitive low-latency algorithms to that of AlphaDev in each case. However, for algorithms that require branching (if–else statements), in which algorithm length and latency are not well correlated, AlphaDev discovers lower latency solutions than AlphaDev-S, even when warm starting this algorithm with a near-optimal solution. See Methods for an in-depth analysis of these algorithms.Generalization to additional domainsTo test the generality of AlphaDev, we train the agent on a set of additional domains. These include a protocol buffer deserialization subroutine called VarInt, presented below, and a competitive coding problem (see Appendix D in Supplementary Information for more details). The competitive coding domain latency performance is reported in Table 1b.Protocol Buffer is Google’s open-source data format used to serialize structured data45. This format is commonly used in cases in which performance or network load is of primary concern. The VarInt algorithm46 is a key component in both the serialization and deserialization processes. We trained the AlphaDev agent as in variable sort to optimize the VarInt deserialization function with respect to correctness and measured latency. For correctness, we reward the agent for correctly deserializing each input. We use a set of 80 inputs and corresponding outputs that cover common protobuf use cases. AlphaDev learns an optimized VarInt deserialization function and manages to significantly outperform the human benchmark for single valued inputs. Our agent discovers a branchless solution that is both shorter (Table 1a) and roughly three times faster than the human benchmark (Table 1b). In doing so, the agent also discovered a new VarInt assignment move in which AlphaDev learns to combine two operations into a single instruction leading to latency savings. See Appendix D.1 in Supplementary Information for a full overview of this move. This is a strong indication that AlphaDev is capable of generalizing to optimize non-trivial, real-world algorithms.Libc++ sort patchThe sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library are called many times by larger sorting algorithms and are therefore fundamental components of the library. We reverse engineered the low-level assembly sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 to C++ and discovered that our sort implementations led to improvements of up to 70% for sequences of a length of five and roughly 1.7% for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements. These improvements are for the uint32, uint64 and float data types for ARMv8, Intel Skylake and AMD Zen 2 CPU architectures; see Appendix E in Supplementary Information for the full performance tables. The performance improvements are due to both the branchless conditional assembly generated by AlphaDev as well as the new AlphaDev swap move. For sort 5, we used a 43 length algorithm discovered by AlphaDev, as it led to a more efficient C++ implementation. These algorithms were sent for review and have officially been included in the libc++ standard sorting library3. It is the first change to these sub-routines in over a decade. This is also the first time that any component in this sort library has been replaced by an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We estimate that these routines are being called trillions of times every day1,35,47.DiscussionAlphaDev discovers new, state-of-the-art sorting algorithms from scratch that have been incorporated into the LLVM C++ library, used by millions of developers and applications around the world23,24,25. Both AlphaDev and stochastic search are powerful algorithms. An interesting direction for future research is to investigate combining these algorithms together to realize the complementary advantages of both approaches.It is important to note that AlphaDev can, in theory, generalize to functions that do not require exhaustive verification of test cases. For example, hashing functions48 as well as cryptographic hashing functions49 define function correctness by the number of hashing collisions. Therefore, in this case, AlphaDev can optimize for minimizing collisions as well as latency. AlphaDev can also, in theory, optimize complicated logic components within the body of large, impressive functions. We hope that AlphaDev can provide interesting insights and inspire new approaches in both the artificial intelligence and program synthesis communities.MethodsBackgroundAlphaZeroAlphaZero33 is an RL algorithm that leverages MCTS as a policy improvement operator. It consists of (1) a representation network frep that outputs a latent representation ht of the state St; and (2) a prediction network fpred that predicts the expected return (the value) \\({\\hat{v}}_{t}\\) and a policy (that is, distribution over the action space) \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) from a given latent state. The algorithm uses the true dynamics and reward when planning. MuZero38 is a model-based variant of AlphaZero that has the same representation and prediction networks, but also learns a model of the dynamics and predicts rewards, which it uses for planning. Specifically, it learns a dynamics network fdyn that predicts the next latent state \\({{\\bf{\\text{h}}}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) and reward \\({\\hat{r}}_{t}^{k+1}\\) resulting from a transition. Note that the subscript t denotes timesteps in the real environment and the superscript k represents timesteps in the model.On reaching a new state, AlphaZero proceeds by first encoding the state into a latent representation with the representation network. Then, the true dynamics or dynamics network (for MuZero) as well as the prediction network fpred(ht) are used to simulate several trajectories that fill out a search tree, by sampling state transitions. At each node, the actions are selected using an optimistic strategy called the predictor upper confidence tree bound32, meant to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (progressing further down the subtree of the current estimate of the best action). This strategy starts out by following the predicted policy \\({\\hat{\\pi }}_{t}\\) closely, and gradually shifts towards maximizing the predicted value function. Ultimately, an action is recommended by sampling from the root node with probability proportional to its visit count during MCTS. The predicted policy is then trained to match the visit counts of the MCTS policy in an attempt to distil the search procedure into a policy such that subsequent iterations of MCTS will disregard nodes that are not promising.Sorting networksSorting networks are very efficient as their structures can be parallelized on modern CPU architectures. They therefore tend to achieve faster runtime performance, especially on small sorts, compared to popular and efficient base case algorithms such as insertion sort17,43,50. A sorting network43 consists of two types of item called comparators (vertical lines) and wires (horizontal lines) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Each wire carries a value from left to right. When two wires intersect at a comparator, the values on the two wires are compared. If the value of the bottom wire is smaller than the value of the top wire, then the values are swapped between wires as seen in Extended Data Fig. 2b. A programmatic implementation of a sorting network consists of executing these swaps on particular pairs of elements from the input sequence in a particular order.Action pruning rulesWe pruned the action space by removing some program invariances (for example, the order of register allocation) and illegal instructions (for example, comparing two memory locations). This helps reducing the size of the action space and increases convergence rate. For our experiments, we used the following rules:Memory locations are always read in incremental order.Registers are allocated in incremental order.We cannot compare or conditionally move to a memory location (illegal).We can read and write to each memory location only once.We cannot use non-initialized registers (illegal).Do not perform consecutive compare instructions.Training regimeWe train AlphaDev on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v.3, with a total batch size of 1,024 per TPU core. We use up to 16 TPU cores and train for 1 million iterations. On the actor side, the games are played on standalone TPU v.4, and we use up to 512 actors. In practice, across all tasks, training takes, in the worst case, 2 days to converge.AlphaDev-SIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other possible approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8 and incorporated it into AlphaDev as the learning algorithm to optimize sorting functions. We refer to this adapted version as AlphaDev-S. Our re-implementation has been specifically optimized for the sorting domain. This includes implementing the algorithm to run with our assembly environment, defining a correctness and performance loss function specific to sorting and running extensive hyperparameter sweeps to identify the best variant. The cost function used for AlphaDev-S is c = correctness + α × performance where correctness corresponds to computing the number of incorrect input sequence elements that are still unsorted, performance corresponds to the algorithm length reward and α is a weight trading off the two cost functions. We are unable to optimize directly for latency as this slows down the learning algorithm considerably making learning infeasible. It should be noted that this function has been adapted to support the same set of assembly instructions used by AlphaDev as well as prune the same set of incorrect or illegal actions. It also uses the same program correctness computation module (Fig. 2b) to compute the correctness term.AlphaDev-S is then executed by first proposing a transformation to the program stored in the buffer (which may be empty or initialized with an already sorted program). The correctness and performance terms are then computed using the program correctness module and algorithm length, respectively. If the cost is lower than the current best cost, the new program is accepted with high probability, otherwise it is rejected. We will now discuss the correctness cost function and transform weights in more detail.Correctness costFor the correctness cost function, we implemented three types of cost function. The first one is defined as the percentage of incorrectly placed items: \\(\\frac{P-P{C}_{t}}{P}\\) where P is the total number of items to place and PCt is number of correctly placed items at timestep t. The second variant is the square root of this equation. The final cost function takes the square root of the difference \\(\\sqrt{-{PC}_{t}}\\) and this is what yielded the best performance.Program transformationsWe enabled several program transformations such as adding an instruction to increase the size of the program (Add Transform), swapping two instructions (Swap Transform), randomly changing an Opcode for an instruction (Opcode Transform), randomly sampling an Operand for a chosen instruction (Operand Transform) and randomly sample an Opcode and its corresponding Operands (Instruction Transform). It is possible to influence the sampling of these transforms to encourage some to be sampled more or less frequently. We optimized the weights for sampling transforms by running an extensive hyperparameter sweep.Investigative studies for AlphaDev variantsWe now present a set of investigative studies that help to better understand the advantages and limitations of the DRL and the stochastic search learning algorithms used in AlphaDev. We compare AlphaDev to AlphaDev-S. We implemented two variants of AlphaDev-S: (1) Cold Start (AlphaDev-S-CS) and (2) Warm Start (AlphaDev-S-WS). AlphaDev-S-CS uses no previous information and has to generate a program from an empty program buffer. AlphaDev-S-WS’s buffer is warm started with a correct sorting program (for example, optimal sorting network assembly program) and it edits the program to optimize it further. We compared the variants with AlphaDev in both the individual and variable sort algorithm setups.Because AlphaDev always learns from scratch with no previous knowledge, the direct comparison would be to the cold start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-CS. However, as initial near-optimal programs may sometimes be available, we also compare AlphaDev to the warm start stochastic search version: AlphaDev-S-WS.It should be noted that the stochastic search variants are unable to optimize directly for latency, as this would make learning infeasible because of computational efficiency. As such, our AlphaDev-S variants optimize for algorithm length. Then, at the end of training, we iterate through the set of generated programs for AlphaDev-S across varying lengths and identify the program with the lowest latency.In each case, the stochastic search algorithms (AlphaDev-S) are run using at least the same computational resources and wall-clock time to that of AlphaDev.Fixed sortWe first examine the performance of the various approaches for the fixed sort algorithms. In this case, all algorithmic variants optimize for algorithm length as algorithm length and latency are highly correlated in the conditional branchless setting (see Supplementary Information for more details).In the cold start setting, AlphaDev-S-CS is unable to find the optimal programs in each case as seen in Extended Data Table 2a. In addition, AlphaDev-S-CS explores orders of magnitude more programs than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. In the warm start setting, AlphaDev-S is warm started with a near-optimal sorted program, and is able to match the performance of AlphaDev in each case as shown in Extended Data Table 2a. It is more computationally efficient than AlphaDev as shown in Extended Data Table 2c but explores orders of magnitude more programs for sort 3 and sort 5 as shown in Extended Data Table 2b. It can be argued that AlphaDev-S-WS has a substantial advantage in this scenario as it is provided with an initial near-optimal program. We will show in the Variable sort section that when the algorithms become more complicated and branching is introduced, warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal program is not enough and can cause it to get stuck in suboptimal solutions.Brute-force approachWe also used a brute-force approach to prove that no program shorter than 17 instructions exists for sort 3. We had to enumerate roughly 1032 programs and, even with pruning heuristics, it took more than 3 days to prove this hypothesis. For sort 4 and above this approach is infeasible.Latency benchmarking suiteThe length of a program is only a proxy for the performance of an algorithm. As we introduce branching structures, the length and latency of a program are not well correlated. Therefore, we run the programs on actual machines and measure their latency. Microbenchmarking is very challenging given the numerous noise sources that could affect the measurements. This is especially true when running on shared machines where there could be interference from other processes. Our approach is to have a separate benchmarking service, replicated on separated machines, so that we can quickly perform many measurements in a controlled environment under different conditions. The system works as follows:The RL agent processes 1,000 measurements across the machines using the replicated service.For each measurement, the service runs the given sorting algorithm over 10,000 random inputs (for example, for sort 3 this would be 3 × 10,000 = 30,000 random integers).We measure the time taken using a CPU performance counter (CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.CORE).We then take the fifth percentile as our final measurement, because we assume that most noise sources are one-sided (for example, cache misses, pre-emptions and so on). During training we process the measurements across ten machines for computational efficiency. After training, we benchmark AlphaDev’s solution against the baseline solutions, and process the measurements across 100 machines for more accuracy and noise reduction. For each benchmark, we compute confidence intervals using the distribution-free two-sided confidence interval for a quantile tabular method44.Variable sortWhen optimizing directly for latency, AlphaDev outperforms AlphaDev-S-WS on VarSort3, VarSort4 and VarSort5 as seen in Extended Data Table 3a. AlphaDev-S-CS fails to find a solution in each case. In the cases of VarSort4 and VarSort5, program length and latency are not correlated (see Supplementary Information for more details). This indicates that when program length cannot be used as a proxy for performance, AlphaDev is able to find lower latency solutions compared to AlphaDev-S. This is even in the case where the stochastic search is warm started with a near-optimal program. In addition, AlphaDev converges to the optimal solution after exploring a maximum of 12M programs as seen in Extended Data Table 3b. This is orders of magnitude lower than that of AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively (31 trillion programs in the worst case).Exploration hypothesisWe proposed that AlphaDev-S struggles to discover programs when learning from scratch and gets stuck in local optima when warm started because of its limited exploration capabilities as a result of the stochastic search procedure. Extended Data Fig. 3 shows two-dimensional t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) projections51 of AlphaDev and AlphaDev-S’s assembly algorithms discovered during their respective training procedures for VarSort5. The features used in the projection include correctness, latency, algorithm length and a histogram count of the instructions used per algorithm. Extended Data Fig. 3a indicates the regions in algorithm space explored by AlphaDev, AlphaDev-S-CS and AlphaDev-S-WS, respectively, whereas Extended Data Fig. 3b superimposes algorithm correctness onto each point in the t-SNE projection in which the colour indicates the correctness of each discovered algorithm, ranging from incorrect algorithms (purple) to correct algorithms (yellow). The AlphaDev-S variants both cover a densely packed circular region around their initial seed, which highlights the breadth-first nature of their stochastic search procedure. This illustrates that AlphaDev-S-CS fails to navigate through the space of incorrect algorithms in a reasonable amount of time and discover correct algorithms when learning from scratch. A similar argument applies to AlphaDev-S-WS whereby, when optimizing from an already correct but suboptimal expert demonstration, the algorithm is biased towards exploring its vicinity and struggles to escape this local maxima. By contrast, AlphaDev has more diverse algorithm space coverage, as the long-term value function is a guiding signal for discovering new and interesting parts of algorithm space. As seen in Extended Data Fig. 3b, it is capable of escaping the space of incorrect algorithms to discover a new space of correct algorithms, highlighting the exploration advantages afforded by AlphaDev.Related workAssembly optimizationThere are numerous approaches to optimizing assembly programs, which we have classified into three groups: enumerative search, stochastic search and symbolic search5.First, enumerative search techniques include brute-force program enumeration4,5,6 as well as implicit enumeration using symbolic theorem proving52,53. These approaches search through the space of programs to find a solution based on a predefined set of programs, heuristic and/or cost function. These approaches struggle to span large regions of program space, especially as the size and complexity of the program increases.Second, stochastic search techniques circumvent comprehensive enumeration by relying on sampling mechanisms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling5,6,8,9. Rajeev Alur et al.5 define a correctness specification, provided by a logical formula that uses symbols from a background theory. The goal is to then find an implementation expression such that logical formula defining the specification is valid. The idea is to iteratively add test cases and then search and expand the program to solve the given test cases. They optimize for correctness on problems from the book Hacker’s delight54. Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana et al.6 introduce the LENS algorithm that is based on running enumerative, stochastic and symbolic search in parallel, while relying on handcrafted pruning rules. This setup is capable of optimizing up to 21 instructions, and cannot optimize for latency nor support branching. Another algorithm8 is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo rejection sampling and applies transformations to programs in assembly using a loss function that is a function of correctness and performance. Many of these approaches are prone to getting stuck in local minima and may also struggle as the size and/or complexity of the program increases. In addition, incorporating actual, measured latency into these approaches are either infeasible or prohibitively expensive.Third, symbolic search approaches can also be implemented to optimize assembly programs. These include SAT solvers55, SMT solvers5,6 and Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs)56,57. However, these approaches suffer from scaling issues. For example, classical solvers require a problem to be translated into a certain canonical form. It usually requires an expert in the said solvers and a substantial amount of time to find an efficient formulation. In addition, for any new modification of the problem, this has to be repeated. Classical solvers are also hard to parallelize and thus, it is challenging to leverage more hardware to speed up the solving process. Another symbolic search algorithm is Cholorphyll10 that implements a multi-phase approach. It first requires as input a source program with partition annotations that specify where code and data reside. Then, a layout synthesizer maps program fragments onto physical cores to minimize computational costs. The code is then separated into per-core program fragments and the program fragments are compiled into machine code. At this point, a superoptimizer optimizes each of these fragments.SIMD optimizationVarious approaches58,59,60 have also been applied to sorting functions that run in the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)61 setup. This setup is capable of parallelizing instruction execution, but is not supported at present in popular libraries such as LLVM’s libc++ std::sort library. One example is that from Gilles Barthe et al.7 that proposes a methodology for optimizing programs by automatically vectorizing loops with SIMD instructions. They do this by introducing a framework for verifying the correctness of transformations to a program and performing a search-based procedure using the said transformation. Their framework can discover SIMD looping structures of up to nine instructions in 0.12 s, which corresponds to a minimum 2× speed-up.RL approaches for program synthesisThere are also several studies using RL for program optimization. Kevin Ellis et al.62 learn a policy and value function to write and evaluate code, as well as performing a Monte Carlo-style search strategy during inference. This work requires a pretraining step and aims to generate correct programs that satisfy a predefined specification. The approach is successfully applied to computer-aided design and string editing programs. SuperSonic63 uses an RL meta-optimizer to select between different RL architectures, using a Multi-Armed Bandit policy search to find a state representation, reward function and RL algorithm that is optimal for the current task. This requires keeping track of many RL algorithms and architectures, which are used as part of the state space. By contrast, our approach only focuses on training a single RL architecture, taking advantage of MCTS search and powerful state representations. Shypula et al.64 create a supervised assembly dataset and use it to train a Transformer model for mapping unoptimized to optimized code, followed by an RL stage for improving the solution quality. Our method does not require a supervised dataset or two separate training and finetuning stages, and optimizes everything end-to-end using RL and search instead. Chen et al.65 define their own domain specific language and perform input–output program synthesis that better uses the intermediate program representation to guide the synthesis routine. They show that this can be incorporated with RL, using the setup of Rudy Bunel et al.66 and improve the correctness of generated functions. They do not, however, optimize for program length or latency.Input–output examples for program synthesisA large body of work addresses the problem of learning programs from input–output pairs. One type of approach learns a neural network for matching inputs to outputs directly11,13,67,68. This approach is difficult to integrate into existing libraries and can struggle to generalize to previously unseen inputs, although there has been some encouraging recent progress using graph representations69. Another type of approach is to perform a search in program space, guided by a learned model12,70,71,72. For instance, Chen et al.70 use a model that predicts the next program token on the basis of a partial program and the input–output pairs. This bears some similarities to how search is guided in our approach: the learned policy prior in AlphaZero is a model for predicting the next token, learned on the basis of a combination of a partial program and that program’s effects on the inputs. However, we are interested in finding correct and efficient programs, which we achieve by further learning a value function for approximating the expected latency of partial programs, and using AlphaZero to incorporate this value function into the search process.Deep learning for code generationThere are also several deep learning approaches that use large languages models to generate code. These approaches vary in their uses from transpilation, code refactoring and explaining code15 to generating human-level competitive code using a natural language description14. That particular work aims to generate correct code, but does not focus on generating low-latency solutions.Sort-based program optimizationThere are several program synthesis studies that have tackled sorting algorithms. For example, White et al.26 use RL for learning sorting functions. Their work uses several heuristics and a domain specific language to yield a sorting algorithm called reinforcement programming sort. Srivastava et al.27 encodes the program synthesis as a verification problem. Specifically, they represent a synthesis task as a tuple consisting of the functional expression, the domains and guards appearing in the synthesized program and the resource constraints. The idea is that, given a prespecified resource constraint, their synthesizer produces a program that meets the predefined specification to ensure correctness. They apply this to discover merge sort and quick sort. Jason Ansel et al.28 takes as input predefined algorithms (for example, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort) and then determines when to select these algorithms for execution using its autotuner function. It does so by defining a language that contains rules and transforms that dictate how the algorithms are selected and where they are executed.Data availabilityThe data used to train the system were generated synthetically according to the procedures explained in the paper. The algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for the copy and swap operators are presented in the main paper. We have also released the discovered AlphaDev assembly implementations for sort 3–8 as well as VarSort3, 4 and 5 on Github at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev. We have included exhaustive tests to ensure that each implementation is correct. In addition, Appendix G in Supplementary Information contains a list of additional, correct sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5. The performance of the sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 algorithms on the official LLVM benchmarking suite for three different CPU architectures as well as floats, int32 and int64 data types is detailed in Appendix E in the Supplementary Information. In addition, the AlphaDev sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 implementations can be found in the LLVM libc++ standard sorting library3.Code availabilityWe have also released pseudocode at https://github.com/deepmind/alphadev that includes the environment, the full actor and training loops as well as the core MCTS algorithm. In addition, we include our actual JAX implementation of our policy, value and representation networks that enable the architectures to be reproduced. Finally, we have a config file containing the hyperparameter definitions to be used with the agent.ReferencesAmazon. Amazon S3—two trillion objects, 1.1 million requests/second.

25	SVG versus Canvas: Which technology to choose and why?	https://www.jointjs.com/blog/svg-versus-canvas	scraped	reddit	["SVG","Canvas"]	SVG versus Canvas: Choosing the right technology for your web applicationSetting the sceneChoosing what technology to use can often be a time consuming process. A dilemma can often arise if you are unsure of the benefits or drawbacks of each prospective choice. This is understandable as the last thing you want is to choose a particular technology, and later realize you should have gone with a different option for one reason or another.Debates about SVG versus Canvas are no different. A quick search on the topic will return a multitude of articles, and stackoverflow questions comparing the two technologies. It can be a daunting task to piece together all of the information in the hope of making a decision you can be confident in.In the following article, we will cover some of the same topics you have probably read about elsewhere, but hope to provide you with a more nuanced view. We will also shed some light on what implications those topics have for developers and business owners in practical terms.Before getting into the weeds of the debate, in an article titled SVG versus Canvas, it would be remiss not to at least mention some of the basic differences between the two technologies at the outset, so let’s get to it!Vectors and PixelsTwo households, both alike in creating visual content for the web, but fundamentally different in their approach. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML based markup language used to describe 2D vector graphics. Canvas, on the other hand, allows users to draw on the HTML Canvas element via a JavaScript API.Canvas code example:-- CODE language-svg --<canvas id="canvas"></canvas><script>const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");ctx.fillStyle = "green";ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);</script>‍SVG code example:-- CODE language-svg --<svg> <rect width="150" height="100" fill="green" /></svg>From the beginning, SVG was developed as an open standard by W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium), that means it was designed specifically to work well with other web standards. Generally, you can think of SVG as declarative drawing instructions that can be added alongside your HTML.The history of Canvas is a little more muddled. Originally introduced by Apple, it was later standardized by WHATWG (the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). As Canvas was originally created as a proprietary element by Apple, its adherence to web standards is questionable, and still lacking in important areas to this day.The most pertinent difference is how each technology presents its content. Canvas is raster based, meaning it’s arrays of pixels arranged on a grid, while SVG is vector based, meaning it uses mathematical metadata when describing a graphic. The advantage of the latter is that when zooming or scaling, SVG will maintain its integrity, remaining crisp and clean on different-sized monitors and resolutions. Canvas content, including text, doesn’t preserve clarity when resized.A second, and at first glance, seemingly less important difference is that each SVG element is present in the DOM (Document Object Model), while Canvas is represented as a sole element. The reason why this is relevant will become more apparent later.Now that we have established that both technologies can draw stuff, let’s dig a little deeper on some important aspects to consider when making decisions about SVG and Canvas.Accessibility: What happens in Canvas, stays in CanvasA blazingly fast ™ website with incredible content is all for nothing if it’s not accessible to its users. The same idea can be applied to creating information-rich visual graphics, and the technology you choose to create those graphics can play an integral role in determining just how accessible they are.If you want to talk about people with disabilities, they represent 16% of the global population according to the World Health Organization. While all of those people obviously don’t use assistive software to navigate the web, the number is difficult to ignore if you are a business owner who wants to broaden their user base, or if you are worried about the huge influx of lawsuits regarding the inaccessible web in recent years. Not only is accessibility a good business practice, but it’s the right thing to do in order to create the best experience for everybody.In light of this, how do SVG and Canvas stack up against each other in terms of accessibility? Earlier, we mentioned that Canvas is a single element within the DOM. To put it frankly, this has huge repercussions for accessibility. Canvas doesn’t provide any information about the drawn content, nor does it expose any information to accessibility tools. MDN puts it rather bluntly:“In general, you should avoid using canvas in an accessible website or app.”In contrast, as SVG and all its content is in the DOM, it naturally conveys semantic meaning, and assistive technology can access sub-elements, text and links. As SVG was designed with web standards in mind, it can be further enhanced by accessibility standards such as ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications). That means what is visually represented in a graphic, can also be conveyed in the markup itself, allowing assistive software to get access to this information.Is it possible to convey HTML Canvas content as markup? This is actually an important question in terms of Canvas and accessibility. The short answer is … it depends. Does your Canvas display some simple static shapes, or does it contain a complex interactive diagram? W3C (The World Wide Web Consortium), the primary web standards organization, says the following:“When authors use the canvas element, they must also provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially the same function or purpose as the canvas's bitmap. This content may be placed as content of the canvas element. The contents of the canvas element, if any, are the element's fallback content.”Fallback content in the form of a text description can certainly convey the characteristics of a simple static shape. When it comes to a dynamic diagram, providing fallback content that conveys the same function becomes a little more troublesome. In fact, the HTML specification says best practice is to include focusable elements as fallback content corresponding to each focusable part of the Canvas. At this point, you might be asking yourself, why not just use SVG in the first place?Canvas is often sold as “not having to deal with the overhead of the DOM”. In terms of accessibility, that “overhead” is your users.Performance, a bird’s eye viewIn a large proportion of articles and stackoverflow answers, performance is the main reason provided for choosing Canvas over SVG. The topic is often reduced to a one-liner such as “If you want to render 10,000 elements, use Canvas!”. What more do you need to know, right?An incorrect assertion that you may also come across in these discussions is that Canvas always outperforms SVG, but that’s not necessarily the case. SVG is actually more performant with a small number of objects, or over a large surface area. If you work with a small surface area, or a large number of objects, Canvas is out in front.Other points that could be relevant are the type of content and the manner in which users will interact with your application, or if anything can be done to alleviate the performance advantage that Canvas has in some use cases.Consider a scatter plot with 10,000 data points. Generally, this type of chart provides an overview of some dataset by plotting 2 variables, and suggests some correlation between them. The important information is gleaned from looking at the points as a whole, not at each one individually.In terms of UI (User Interface), you can assume the user doesn’t need to zoom in on each point, or that each circle would have child elements such as text or images. If you wanted to introduce a timeline to animate each point over time, you can certainly start reaching for Canvas as your tool of choice.The type of information you need to visualize more often than not determines the manner in which it’s displayed. What if each data point needs to be an interactive card-like element with text, images, and action buttons? How will your users interact with this content?Apart from it being less likely to have 10,000 data points you need to visualize in this manner, how important would it be to view all these elements as a whole? In this instance, the detail of each individual element is probably what users are most interested in, and the amount of these elements that could be viewed simultaneously in a useful way is certainly limited.This begs the question, is there any strategy that could be employed to improve performance? On the remote chance that someone needed to view 10,000 information-rich elements as a whole, can a simple view of each element be rendered instead? After all, the element details wouldn’t be legible anyway. What about rendering only a subset of elements at a given time? In the age of “lazy loading”, a good use case would be to only render visible elements within the viewport, saving valuable milliseconds.In fact some libraries, including JointJS, provide similar solutions already. JointJS can avoid rendering content which is not visible to the user. When deciding which technology to use, it may be worth your time asking similar questions. If the primary advantage of Canvas is somewhat diminished, are you willing to sacrifice all of the other benefits SVG provides?More meaningful testing with SVGEnsuring your application behaves as expected is an integral part of the development process. In order to ascertain that your graphic functions correctly, debugging problems and testing functionality will be ingrained in your workflow. Once again, when comparing Canvas and SVG, it’s difficult not to return to the fact that Canvas is a solitary HTML element in the DOM. This has numerous practical implications which may affect the speed or reliability of delivering your software.Naturally, one of the first resources a developer will use when presented with a visual bug is to inspect an element in the DOM with developer tools. It’s a familiar process that can reveal a lot of crucial information quickly, such as if the element is even present in the DOM in the first place, or if it has the expected characteristics, and so on. This all contributes to identifying problems swiftly, and addressing them as needed.As a lone Canvas element acts on the principle of what you see is what you get, developers are deprived of this point of contact with their applications, and will often have to pore over longer Canvas code to find an issue, losing valuable time in doing so.In order to minimize the amount of debugging you have to do, you’ll probably want to introduce testing in your workflows. Since SVG and Canvas are both used to create graphics, it’s usually imperative that you test the UI (User Interface) of your applications. Some of the popular E2E (end-to-end) testing frameworks that are used to automate this process are Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium.One thing these frameworks have in common is that they work under the assumption that DOM elements are accessible. Elements are located via the concept of “Selectors”, a catch-all term that can include CSS selectors, accessibility roles, or even text. The fact that none of this information is readily available when using Canvas should immediately raise alarm bells.If attempting to do E2E testing with Canvas, you’ll first likely have to write lots of custom code to locate the Canvas “elements”, then have to capture events on the Canvas element itself, or use some workaround to pretend to interact with elements without actually generating any DOM events.The goal of E2E testing is to test applications from a real user’s perspective. Any makeshift solution that could be implemented with the aim of emulating this process for Canvas will simply never be a convincing substitute. The bottom line is, if you want to do authentic end-to-end testing of your UI, SVG is the way to go.What the heck is Foreign Object?It might seem strange to focus on a specific SVG element as an advantageous reason for choosing SVG, but it’s not without merit. If a requirement for your graphic is to have interactive elements, developers are generally a habitual bunch. They will often reach for technologies they are familiar with, and in web land, the dominant force in this regard is still good old HTML.‍Foreign Object essentially allows the addition of HTML in your SVG elements. Embedding HTML text, creating basic interactive elements like buttons, or working with HTML inputs is all made a straightforward process. If you want to work with HTML on Canvas, a more unconventional approach such as rendering HTML on top of an underlying element will have to be adopted.While this technique can be successful, it comes with a lot of additional complexity, such as the need to keep dimensions and position of the HTML in sync with the element itself. Taking advantage of foreign object in SVG allows you to create HTML-rich elements while avoiding some of the difficulties of other approaches.Don’t believe us? Learn more about foreign object in SVG in our JointJS tutorial, and see what you can create.CSS and SVG play nicelyCSS is, and will remain one of the main pillars of the modern web. The ability to introduce uniform changes via CSS results in more maintainable applications. As SVG and CSS play nicely together, all of that CSS goodness extends to your SVG, allowing for even more modular code.This integration is so seamless, it’s often overlooked just how easy it is to update some SVG styles using CSS pseudo-classes, such as :hover. A painful amount of code has to be written in order to achieve similar functionality with Canvas.Need to get creative with some more vibrant interactions? Animation is now ubiquitous online, and CSS allows the implementation of complex animations with relative ease, often outperforming any JavaScript equivalents. These animation techniques can be utilized with all DOM elements, including SVG.CSS is not a static technology either. The evolution of CSS also means that your SVG code can evolve alongside it, benefiting from new standards and functionality, often adopted from CSS preprocessors. Component based architecture is ever present in the web world. With great new features like native CSS nesting, this architecture will be a mainstay for years to come, allowing for even more organization within SVG applications. As you can see, when evaluating a debate about Canvas versus SVG, those two technologies by themselves don’t paint the whole picture.Bits and BobsNot all facets of a debate about SVG and Canvas need to remain within the realm of the development world, there are also some external aspects which may be worth considering when choosing a technology, such as team structure, or how your content is viewed by search engines.Teams usually consist of many roles, each member has their own strengths and type of work they focus on. Developers are often not the strongest designers, and as a result many teams will include both. The path to creating beautiful looking software, usually begins at the feet of designers. If you are lucky enough to have designers at your disposal, that means a lot of work can be entrusted to them, freeing up developers to focus on what they do best.Need a beautiful set of icons for your startup idea? If working with SVG, this entire process can be taken care of by your design team without a lot of input from developers. Modern design tools like Figma or Adobe illustrator allow the export of SVG, so an icon set can be passed to your development team upon completion, and embedded in your application with relative ease. As SVG is just markup, developers can update any other SVG properties as needed without any back and forth. As images for Canvas will always be static, extra coordination among team members is needed to ensure all image properties are in order before handing them over. Not to mention that you’ll need a little extra JavaScript to add the images to Canvas.SEO (Search Engine Optimization) isn’t the first thing that pops into one’s mind when comparing Canvas and SVG, but it can certainly be beneficial to your business. SVG and Canvas both excel at complex graphics, but only one of them will be searchable and indexable. At a basic level, when users are presented with a large amount of text, it’s possible even for most novices to utilize a command/ctrl + F command on their keyboard in order to find some relevant text. This simply isn’t possible with Canvas. A nice side effect of the DOM is that the text in SVG will also be indexable. Presenting crucial information in graphic form could be incredibly desirable depending on the use case. Using search engines like Google, your users will be able to discover text content through your graphics when using SVG.Last thoughts on SVGSVG and Canvas are both established technologies, so whichever one you choose, you will be supported by huge ecosystems and communities. Based on the points raised in this article, it won’t surprise you to find that our preferred tool of choice is SVG, but Canvas certainly has its use cases too. In our opinion, the practical and ethical benefits of SVG far outweigh what Canvas has to offer, and if the performance benefit of Canvas can be mitigated with techniques such as virtual rendering, the question remains if you are willing to leave all of the advantages that SVG has to offer on the table? Lastly, if some milliseconds will make or break your application, it may be worth your time taking a look at the WebGL/WebGPU APIs instead of the Canvas API.AuthorsRead nextDemo Wednesday: Isometric diagrams with SVGDemo Wednesday: Searchable SitemapDemo Wednesday: JointJS+ ChatGPT MindMapSpeed up your development with a powerful library	2023-06-07	title too long

6	Building startup with AI cofounder (day 21): building an MVP using GraphQL	https://knowlo.co/blog/day-21-building-an-mvp-signup-flow-and-graphql/	scraped	reddit	["AI","GraphQL"]	Day 21: Building an MVP – signup flow and GraphQLCofounderGPT and I got stuck on Day 19 with AppSync JavaScript resolvers. Everything worked great until we tried to deploy the app and realized that JavaScript resolvers do not work for unit resolvers! Currently, they only support pipeline resolvers.Resolving the resolvers issueAs mentioned in the previous article, besides JavaScript resolvers, we have the following options: VTL resolvers and Lambda functions.VTL resolvers are hard to write and even harder to test. I have some experience with them, and CofounderGPT can probably help. But using VTL is the opposite of fun, so I don’t want to use them unless I have to.On the other side, writing a Lambda function is not hard. However, using a Lambda function to read or write some simple values in the DynamoDB table is overkill. Lambda functions require a bit more code, have a scaling limit (that can be increased, and are also slightly slower than VTL and JavaScript resolvers (because of their initialization or cold start).So, do we have any other options?We do! And it’s a bit crazy, but it should work perfectly fine for our scenario. What if we wrap unit resolvers in a pipeline resolver?Let’s pause here and try to explain unit vs. pipeline resolvers first.Each GraphQL query and mutation require a resolver. Resolver is a function that is a glue between GraphQL API and the rest of the world (data sources). GraphQL does not care about resolver complexity. These functions can do whatever they want if they return the data in an expected format. AWS AppSync has two global types of resolvers: you can write a Lambda function and do whatever you want, or you can write a resolver with VTL and now JavaScript, where you have certain limitations, but you get lower latency, less code, and faster scaling in return.With VTL and JavaScript resolvers, one resolver can only talk to one data source and run a single supported operation. For example, you can read from one DynamoDB table or send one HTTP request. These resolvers are called unit resolvers.If you need to read the data from multiple data sources, you can chain VTL or JavaScript resolvers in a pipeline resolver. Each pipeline resolver has a before template (prepares the request data for units), an after template (packs the response in the response), and a series of functions (each is similar to a unit resolver, with some minor API differences).Because JavaScript resolvers support only pipeline resolvers, we can make a pipeline resolver wrapper for a single function (or unit resolver). The downside of this approach is slightly increased complexity and a slightly slower GraphQL operation (I can guess this because I never measured it, but it’s probably up to 50ms slower). But the upside is that we can still use TypeScript instead of VTL for resolvers. And trust me, that’s a huge benefit!This approach sounds like a hack, and it is a hack, but it seems that we are not the only ones with the same idea! Multiple articles on the internet write about the same approach. For example, the “Hitting the road with AppSync JavaScript resolvers” article uses a CDK construct to “hide” this complexity. This approach makes even more sense when we know that AWS AppSync plans to support unit resolvers in the future. In this case, once the AWS AppSync team releases JavaScrip unit resolver support, we can simply change one part of our code, and all of our resolvers will become unit resolvers!We’ll do the same: I created a new folder in the “lib” folder of the backend project and named it “stack” (I know, I am “very” creative). And then, I created a new file inside with the name “javascript-resolver.ts” (the full path is “backend/lib/stack/javascript-resolver.ts”) and the following content:CofounderGPT is much better at explaining code snippets than I am, so he’s its explanation:And that’s it. We can now use our new construct instead of graphQLApi.createResolver in the main Knowlo CDK stack file. Here’s the new code for our resolver:If we run the npm run cdk deploy -- --parameters LogLevel=DEBUG command to redeploy our stack, everything works fine now. The problem is successfully resolved.Can CofounderGPT generate resolvers?Can I ask CofounderGPT to generate resolvers? AWS AppSync released JavaScript resolvers after the ChatGPT training cutoff point, but we might be able to “teach” CofounderGPT the JavaScript resolver syntax. Let’s try! I used the browsing plugin for the following prompt.Slobodan: Here’s the documentation for AWS AppSync JavaScript resolvers for DynamoDB data source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.html. Can you help me writing JavaScript resolvers in TypeScript for my GraphQL query if I provide the GraphQL schema and the DynamoDB database design?CofounderGPT: Sure, I’d be happy to help you with that. Please provide the details of your GraphQL schema and the DynamoDB database design so I can understand your requirements better and assist you in writing the TypeScript resolvers for AWS AppSync.This was a new conversation, so I sent a GraphQL schema and a DynamoDB table design to CofounderGPT and reminded it that we store all the data in a single table.Slobodan: Can you generate an AppSync JavaScript resolver for the `createProject` mutation? Remember, I need a TypeScript version. And you can access the AppSync JavaScript resolvers documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.html.CofounderGPT: Sure, I can help you create a TypeScript version of the AppSync JavaScript resolver for the createProject mutation. Here’s how you might do it based on the provided GraphQL schema and DynamoDB single-table design:This resolver function begins by destructuring the input argument from the context. It then generates an id for the new project using the context.util.autoId() function and the current timestamp with context.util.time.nowISO().Next, it creates a project object that includes all the required attributes for a project, including the id, the knowledge base provider, the knowledge base S3 path, the description, the creation timestamp, and an archived status that is initially set to false.Finally, the function returns a PutItem operation request for DynamoDB, with the key being a combination of the generated id for the project and the attribute values being all the properties of the project object.The context.util.dynamodb.toMapValues function is used to convert the JavaScript objects into a format that DynamoDB can store.Please note that this is a very basic resolver function. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to add more complex logic, such as error handling, additional attribute validation, or further manipulation of the data before it is stored in DynamoDB​1​.Slobodan: Excellent! I also need a response function in the same file. See the documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-reference-overview-js.html.CofounderGPT: Based on the provided AWS AppSync documentation, the response handler for your createProject mutation would look like this in TypeScript:This function takes the context object ctx as a parameter and simply returns the result of the mutation operation. The ctx.result object contains the data returned from the DynamoDB operation, which will be the newly created project in this case.This function will be called by AppSync after the request handler function has completed, and its returned value will be used as the response data for the createProject mutation. Since the mutation is expected to return a Project type, the data returned by this function should align with the fields defined in the Project type in your GraphQL schema.It’s worth noting that this function is quite simple and just returns the result of the mutation operation as is. In a more complex application, you might want to perform additional processing in the response handler function, such as transforming the data, performing additional error handling, or implementing custom logic based on the result of the mutation operation​1​.Slobodan: Ok, not bad. But here’s an example for the response function. Can we do something similar to this?CofounderGPT: The example you provided is a more complex response function that performs additional processing on the result of the DynamoDB operation before returning it. Here’s the equivalent function in TypeScript:In this function:This is a common pattern for response functions in AppSync resolvers, where you might want to transform the data returned from DynamoDB and handle any errors that occurred during the operation.Slobodan: You can find more about PutItem API here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_PutItem.html Can you return only the result without version?CofounderGPT: Based on the AWS documentation, the PutItem operation in DynamoDB creates a new item or replaces an old item with a new item (including all the attributes). However, the PutItem operation itself does not return any data in the response. It does not include the item’s details that have been written to the table​1​.As for AWS AppSync, when a PutItem operation is performed through an AppSync resolver, the data that is written to DynamoDB is automatically converted to GraphQL and JSON primitive types, and is made available in the context result (context.result)​3​.In your provided example response function, it seems like you are trying to remove the version from the result before returning it. This would work if the PutItem operation actually returned the item data. However, as per the DynamoDB documentation, this is not the case. Therefore, you wouldn’t have a version attribute or any other attribute of the item in ctx.result after a PutItem operation.To achieve what you want (i.e., to get the item without the version after a PutItem operation), you would need to perform a separate GetItem operation after PutItem, and then you can modify the returned item as needed before returning it in your response function.Please let me know if you have any more questions or if there’s something else you’d like me to do!Everything CofounderGPT generated and said makes sense. But I need to test it to be sure. However, to test GraphQL queries, I need to go a step back and finish the signup and login process in the frontend app.Signup and loginI did a few things in a frontend application to enable the signup and login flow. A step-by-step explanation would take a lot of space here, so I’ll walk you through the most important parts. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter or Linkedin if you have any questions.At the end, the frontend folder structure looked like this:One of the essential things that I changed is the router in the App.tsx file. It has the following code now:In this code:The AppShell component looks like this:CofounderGPT’s explanation:A few notes:The signup process has two steps: a signup form and a confirmation step (a code is sent via email). This flow is defined in the Signup component. Here’s the code for that component:In this code snippet:This code provides a secure signup process for a user, including validation to ensure that the information entered is correct and a second step to verify the user. It also handles errors and some edge cases, like needing to resend the validation code. There’s still some work here to make it production-ready, but it’s good enough to test the GraphQL part.The signup page looks similar to the following screenshot:Once a user enters the data, the app will send a verification code via email and present the following screen:Once the account is verified, a user is automatically logged in. The dashboard still looks the same (the content is hidden because it’s not connected to GraphQL yet):Finally, the log in screen looks like the following screenshot:These pages give us enough to test and connect GraphQL requests, which we’ll do in the next step of the MVP-building process.ScoreboardSince I don’t trust Google to charge my card automatically for ads because I’ve seen them abuse this power many times in Vacation Tracker.

However, it can be challenging to keep track of all the new and old programming languages, their features, and installation commands. Fortunately, Merwin-asm has created a comprehensive dataset of programming languages that contains information related to them. The dataset is available in JSON format and includes details such as basic description, whether the language is OOP or not, if it is statically or dynamically typed, information about the speed of the language, what it is mostly used for, the market share of the programming language, and installation commands for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.\n\n## Dataset Details\n\nThe dataset contains information about most programming languages, including some that are no longer used. It includes installation commands for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, but some languages may not be installed using command line on Windows. The dataset also warns that the information provided may not be complete and may contain wrong/harmful installation commands. Therefore, it should be used with care. The data was generated with the help of tgpt and is under the MIT license.\n\nThe dataset is stored as a JSON file and has a total of 656 programming languages. If any information was not found, it is set to null. The structure of the dataset is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  "lang_1": {\n    "description": "................",\n    "OOP": "true / false (if it's an object-oriented programming language)",\n    "type": "statically typed / dynamically typed",\n    "speed": "very fast/fast/medium/slow",\n    "mostly_used_for": "..............",\n    "market_share": ".................",\n    "installation": {\n      "windows": "....",\n      "linux": ".....",\n      "macOS": "....."\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## How to Access the Dataset\n\nThe dataset is available on GitHub and can be downloaded using the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/merwin-asm/LanguageIndex.git\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can access the raw dataset using the following link:\n\n```bash\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/merwin-asm/LanguageIndex/main/main.json\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMerwin-asm's comprehensive dataset of programming languages is a valuable resource for developers who want to keep up with the latest programming languages and frameworks. It provides essential information about programming languages, including installation commands, speed, and market share. However, it is essential to use the dataset with care, as it may contain wrong/harmful installation commands and incomplete information.\n

Increase your visibility. Grow your career.Learn more Microsoft released Dev Drive at the Build 2023 developer conference, a custom storage volume geared for developers. Built on top of Microsoft's proprietary ReFS (Resilient File System), Dev Drive is optimized for heavy I/O operations and has improved performance and security capabilities.\nDev Drive includes file-system optimizations and Microsoft claims up to 30% improvement in build times as well as improved security using the new performance mode in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus. In Microsoft Defender performance mode, real-time protection runs asynchronously, balancing security and performance. The balance is reached by delaying security scans until after the file operation has been completed instead of running security scans synchronously while the file operation is being executed. This performance mode is more secure than a folder or process exclusion that disables security scans altogether.\nDev Drive also speeds up other disc-bound operations such as cloning Git repositories, restoring packages, and copying files. Dev Drive is designed for storing source code, package caches and build artifacts but it is not intended for developer tools or installing apps.\nAnother optimization that Dev Drive implements is copy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning. The article on Engineering@Microsoft describes how it works:\nCopy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning in the Windows API documentation, avoids fully copying a file by creating a metadata reference to the original data on-disk. CoW links are like hardlinks but are safe to write to, as the filesystem lazily copies the original data into the link as needed when opened for append or random-access write. With a CoW link you save disk space and time since the link consists of a small amount of metadata and they write fast.\nDev Drive is currently in public preview and is available to Windows Insiders running the Dev Channel of Windows 11. It requires at least 50GB in free space and a minimum of 8GB of RAM though Microsoft recommends 16GB. Users can create a Dev Drive volume as a new virtual hard disk, or it can use unallocated space.\nThose developers who already tried the Dev Drive report getting faster builds, with one user seeing about 40% off npm build and about 20% speedier .NET build. Another user got 25% speed up even though Dev Drive was running on a three-times slower disk.\nDev Drive should appear in the main Windows release channel later this year. It will also be available in Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions for faster CI builds in the cloud. In addition to the original release blog post, Microsoft has published a detailed page that describes how to set up Dev Drive, what limitations it has as well as frequently asked questions.

Built on top of Microsoft's proprietary ReFS (Resilient File System), Dev Drive is optimized for heavy I/O operations and has improved performance and security capabilities.Dev Drive includes file-system optimizations and Microsoft claims up to 30% improvement in build times as well as improved security using the new performance mode in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus. In Microsoft Defender performance mode, real-time protection runs asynchronously, balancing security and performance. The balance is reached by delaying security scans until after the file operation has been completed instead of running security scans synchronously while the file operation is being executed. This performance mode is more secure than a folder or process exclusion that disables security scans altogether.Dev Drive also speeds up other disc-bound operations such as cloning Git repositories, restoring packages, and copying files. Dev Drive is designed for storing source code, package caches and build artifacts but it is not intended for developer tools or installing apps.Another optimization that Dev Drive implements is copy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning. The article on Engineering@Microsoft describes how it works:Copy-on-write (CoW) linking, also known as block cloning in the Windows API documentation, avoids fully copying a file by creating a metadata reference to the original data on-disk. CoW links are like hardlinks but are safe to write to, as the filesystem lazily copies the original data into the link as needed when opened for append or random-access write. With a CoW link you save disk space and time since the link consists of a small amount of metadata and they write fast.Dev Drive is currently in public preview and is available to Windows Insiders running the Dev Channel of Windows 11. It requires at least 50GB in free space and a minimum of 8GB of RAM though Microsoft recommends 16GB. Users can create a Dev Drive volume as a new virtual hard disk, or it can use unallocated space.Those developers who already tried the Dev Drive report getting faster builds, with one user seeing about 40% off npm build and about 20% speedier .NET build. Another user got 25% speed up even though Dev Drive was running on a three-times slower disk.Dev Drive should appear in the main Windows release channel later this year. It will also be available in Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions for faster CI builds in the cloud. In addition to the original release blog post, Microsoft has published a detailed page that describes how to set up Dev Drive, what limitations it has as well as frequently asked questions.About the AuthorGiorgi Dalakishvili Rate this Article This content is in the .NET topic Related Topics:Related EditorialRelated Sponsored ContentRelated SponsorCode, deploy, and scale Java your way.\nMicrosoft Azure supports your workload with abundant choices, whether you're working on a Java app, app server, or framework.

22	Announcing C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code	https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code/	written	reddit	["C#"]	 Announcing C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code Tim Heuer June 6th, 202319 17\nWe are thrilled to announce the preview release of C# Dev Kit, a new Visual Studio Code extension that brings an improved editor-first C# development experience to Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nThe C# Dev Kit is designed to enhance your C# productivity when you’re working in VS Code. It works together with the C# extension, which has been updated to be powered by a new fully open-source Language Server Protocol (LSP) host, creating a performant, extensible, and flexible tooling environment that easily integrates new experiences into C# for VS Code. The source repo for this extension is in the process of being migrated and will be available later this week.\nTry out C# Dev Kit for your C# web and cloud-native projects and share your feedback today!\nWhat is C# Dev Kit?\nC# Dev Kit borrows some familiar concepts from Visual Studio to bring a more productive and reliable C# experience to VS Code. This ensures a great experience whether you are quickly editing a C# file, learning C#, or debugging a backend API. The C# Dev Kit consists of a set of VS Code extensions that work together to provide a rich C# editing experience, AI-powered development, solution management, and integrated testing. As shown in the graphic below, C# Dev Kit consists of:\nThe C# extension, which provides base language services support and continues to be maintained independent of this effort.\nC# Dev Kit extension, which builds from the foundations of Visual Studio to provide solution management, templates, and test discovery/debugging.\nThe IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extension (optional), which brings AI-powered development to the editor.\nManage your projects with a new solution view\nCustomers often praise the power of project management with C#, so like Visual Studio, C# Dev Kit adds a new Solution Explorer view that works alongside the VS Code existing workspace view. This addition provides a curated and structured view of your application for effortless, central project management. This lets you quickly add new projects or files via templates to your solutions and easily build all or part of your solution.\nTest your projects with expanded Test Explorer capabilities\nWith C# Dev Kit, your tests in XUnit, NUnit, MSTest, and bUnit will be discovered and organized for you more easily for fast execution and results navigation. The extension will discover and surface your tests in the Test Explorer pane just like for your other languages. It can also be run via the command palette.\nExperience improved performance and reliability\nC# Dev Kit is powered by the recently updated open-source C# extension, now powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) Host, also open source. The C# extension is built on the incredible foundation started with OmniSharp by the amazing OSS community. Both extensions integrate with components like Roslyn and Razor to deliver superb performance for tools such as IntelliSense, definition and symbol navigation, syntax highlighting, refactoring, and code formatting.\nPrevious Time to IntelliSense\nNew Time to IntelliSense\nPercentage Improvement\n38 seconds\n3.5 seconds\n91%\nBenchmarked using a 2GB sized solution with 40 projects and 500,000 lines of source code.\nIn addition to the performance and reliability gains provided by the updated C# extension, C# Dev Kit lets you enjoy these same performance improvements with the solution, debugging, and testing features.\nWrite your project faster with AI-powered C# development\nAuto-installing as part of C# Dev Kit, the IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extension enhances the AI-assisted support beyond the basic IntelliSense code-completion found in the existing C# extension.

I understand paying for IntelliCode, any Performance tools when they come, stuff like that, but for Test and Solution Explorers, it really feels like a cashgrab.

Vector search is one such tool that is gaining popularity in the world of sports analytics. In particular, it can be used to match historical baseball player stats and identify players with similar performance profiles.\\n\\nVector search is a technique that involves representing data points as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors can then be compared using distance metrics to identify similar data points. In the case of baseball player stats, we can represent each player's performance across different categories (e.g. batting average, home runs, RBIs) as a vector. By comparing these vectors, we can identify players with similar performance profiles.\\n\\nOne application of this technique is to identify historical players who are similar to current players. For example, we can use vector search to identify players from the past who had similar performance profiles to current stars like Mike Trout or Clayton Kershaw. This can help us gain a better understanding of how these current players compare to historical greats.\\n\\nTo implement vector search for baseball player stats, we can use a machine learning library like scikit-learn in Python. Here's an example code snippet:\\n\\n```\\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Create a matrix of player stats\\nplayer_stats = np.array([\\n    [0.300, 40, 120],\\n    [0.280, 35, 110],\\n    [0.320, 45, 130],\\n    [0.290, 30, 100]\\n])\\n\\n# Compute cosine similarity between each pair of players\\nsimilarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(player_stats)\\n\\n# Identify players with similar performance profiles\\nsimilar_players = np.argsort(similarity_matrix[0])[-2:]\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we create a matrix of player stats where each row represents a player and each column represents a different category of performance. We then compute the cosine similarity between each pair of players to create a similarity matrix. Finally, we identify the players with the most similar performance profiles to the first player in the matrix.\\n\\nVector search is just one of many tools that can be used to analyze baseball player stats. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we can gain new insights into the game and its history. As the field of sports analytics continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative approaches to analyzing and understanding data in the world of sports."}
