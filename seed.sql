Larger versions are also shown if\n"1 per page" is selected with the Results Per Page button. Note:\nthumbnails may all be different sizes, due to the fact that the thumbnail is\ncreated at the point of their shader's run (and characteristics (i.e. window\nsize) of that run) in which their shader is saved.

6	Building startup with AI cofounder (day 21): building an MVP using GraphQL	https://knowlo.co/blog/day-21-building-an-mvp-signup-flow-and-graphql/	scraped	reddit	["GraphQL"]	Day 21: Building an MVP – signup flow and GraphQLCofounderGPT and I got stuck on Day 19 with AppSync JavaScript resolvers. Everything worked great until we tried to deploy the app and realized that JavaScript resolvers do not work for unit resolvers! Currently, they only support pipeline resolvers.Resolving the resolvers issueAs mentioned in the previous article, besides JavaScript resolvers, we have the following options: VTL resolvers and Lambda functions.VTL resolvers are hard to write and even harder to test. I have some experience with them, and CofounderGPT can probably help. But using VTL is the opposite of fun, so I don’t want to use them unless I have to.On the other side, writing a Lambda function is not hard. However, using a Lambda function to read or write some simple values in the DynamoDB table is overkill. Lambda functions require a bit more code, have a scaling limit (that can be increased, and are also slightly slower than VTL and JavaScript resolvers (because of their initialization or cold start).So, do we have any other options?We do! And it’s a bit crazy, but it should work perfectly fine for our scenario. What if we wrap unit resolvers in a pipeline resolver?Let’s pause here and try to explain unit vs. pipeline resolvers first.Each GraphQL query and mutation require a resolver. Resolver is a function that is a glue between GraphQL API and the rest of the world (data sources). GraphQL does not care about resolver complexity. These functions can do whatever they want if they return the data in an expected format. AWS AppSync has two global types of resolvers: you can write a Lambda function and do whatever you want, or you can write a resolver with VTL and now JavaScript, where you have certain limitations, but you get lower latency, less code, and faster scaling in return.With VTL and JavaScript resolvers, one resolver can only talk to one data source and run a single supported operation. For example, you can read from one DynamoDB table or send one HTTP request. These resolvers are called unit resolvers.If you need to read the data from multiple data sources, you can chain VTL or JavaScript resolvers in a pipeline resolver. Each pipeline resolver has a before template (prepares the request data for units), an after template (packs the response in the response), and a series of functions (each is similar to a unit resolver, with some minor API differences).Because JavaScript resolvers support only pipeline resolvers, we can make a pipeline resolver wrapper for a single function (or unit resolver). The downside of this approach is slightly increased complexity and a slightly slower GraphQL operation (I can guess this because I never measured it, but it’s probably up to 50ms slower). But the upside is that we can still use TypeScript instead of VTL for resolvers. And trust me, that’s a huge benefit!This approach sounds like a hack, and it is a hack, but it seems that we are not the only ones with the same idea! Multiple articles on the internet write about the same approach. For example, the “Hitting the road with AppSync JavaScript resolvers” article uses a CDK construct to “hide” this complexity. This approach makes even more sense when we know that AWS AppSync plans to support unit resolvers in the future. In this case, once the AWS AppSync team releases JavaScrip unit resolver support, we can simply change one part of our code, and all of our resolvers will become unit resolvers!We’ll do the same: I created a new folder in the “lib” folder of the backend project and named it “stack” (I know, I am “very” creative). And then, I created a new file inside with the name “javascript-resolver.ts” (the full path is “backend/lib/stack/javascript-resolver.ts”) and the following content:CofounderGPT is much better at explaining code snippets than I am, so he’s its explanation:And that’s it. We can now use our new construct instead of graphQLApi.createResolver in the main Knowlo CDK stack file. Here’s the new code for our resolver:If we run the npm run cdk deploy -- --parameters LogLevel=DEBUG command to redeploy our stack, everything works fine now. The problem is successfully resolved.Can CofounderGPT generate resolvers?Can I ask CofounderGPT to generate resolvers? AWS AppSync released JavaScript resolvers after the ChatGPT training cutoff point, but we might be able to “teach” CofounderGPT the JavaScript resolver syntax. Let’s try! I used the browsing plugin for the following prompt.Slobodan: Here’s the documentation for AWS AppSync JavaScript resolvers for DynamoDB data source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.html. Can you help me writing JavaScript resolvers in TypeScript for my GraphQL query if I provide the GraphQL schema and the DynamoDB database design?CofounderGPT: Sure, I’d be happy to help you with that. Please provide the details of your GraphQL schema and the DynamoDB database design so I can understand your requirements better and assist you in writing the TypeScript resolvers for AWS AppSync.This was a new conversation, so I sent a GraphQL schema and a DynamoDB table design to CofounderGPT and reminded it that we store all the data in a single table.Slobodan: Can you generate an AppSync JavaScript resolver for the `createProject` mutation? Remember, I need a TypeScript version. And you can access the AppSync JavaScript resolvers documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.html.CofounderGPT: Sure, I can help you create a TypeScript version of the AppSync JavaScript resolver for the createProject mutation. Here’s how you might do it based on the provided GraphQL schema and DynamoDB single-table design:This resolver function begins by destructuring the input argument from the context. It then generates an id for the new project using the context.util.autoId() function and the current timestamp with context.util.time.nowISO().Next, it creates a project object that includes all the required attributes for a project, including the id, the knowledge base provider, the knowledge base S3 path, the description, the creation timestamp, and an archived status that is initially set to false.Finally, the function returns a PutItem operation request for DynamoDB, with the key being a combination of the generated id for the project and the attribute values being all the properties of the project object.The context.util.dynamodb.toMapValues function is used to convert the JavaScript objects into a format that DynamoDB can store.Please note that this is a very basic resolver function. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to add more complex logic, such as error handling, additional attribute validation, or further manipulation of the data before it is stored in DynamoDB​1​.Slobodan: Excellent! I also need a response function in the same file. See the documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-reference-overview-js.html.CofounderGPT: Based on the provided AWS AppSync documentation, the response handler for your createProject mutation would look like this in TypeScript:This function takes the context object ctx as a parameter and simply returns the result of the mutation operation. The ctx.result object contains the data returned from the DynamoDB operation, which will be the newly created project in this case.This function will be called by AppSync after the request handler function has completed, and its returned value will be used as the response data for the createProject mutation. Since the mutation is expected to return a Project type, the data returned by this function should align with the fields defined in the Project type in your GraphQL schema.It’s worth noting that this function is quite simple and just returns the result of the mutation operation as is. In a more complex application, you might want to perform additional processing in the response handler function, such as transforming the data, performing additional error handling, or implementing custom logic based on the result of the mutation operation​1​.Slobodan: Ok, not bad. But here’s an example for the response function. Can we do something similar to this?CofounderGPT: The example you provided is a more complex response function that performs additional processing on the result of the DynamoDB operation before returning it. Here’s the equivalent function in TypeScript:In this function:This is a common pattern for response functions in AppSync resolvers, where you might want to transform the data returned from DynamoDB and handle any errors that occurred during the operation.Slobodan: You can find more about PutItem API here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_PutItem.html Can you return only the result without version?CofounderGPT: Based on the AWS documentation, the PutItem operation in DynamoDB creates a new item or replaces an old item with a new item (including all the attributes). However, the PutItem operation itself does not return any data in the response. It does not include the item’s details that have been written to the table​1​.As for AWS AppSync, when a PutItem operation is performed through an AppSync resolver, the data that is written to DynamoDB is automatically converted to GraphQL and JSON primitive types, and is made available in the context result (context.result)​3​.In your provided example response function, it seems like you are trying to remove the version from the result before returning it. This would work if the PutItem operation actually returned the item data. However, as per the DynamoDB documentation, this is not the case. Therefore, you wouldn’t have a version attribute or any other attribute of the item in ctx.result after a PutItem operation.To achieve what you want (i.e., to get the item without the version after a PutItem operation), you would need to perform a separate GetItem operation after PutItem, and then you can modify the returned item as needed before returning it in your response function.Please let me know if you have any more questions or if there’s something else you’d like me to do!Everything CofounderGPT generated and said makes sense. But I need to test it to be sure. However, to test GraphQL queries, I need to go a step back and finish the signup and login process in the frontend app.Signup and loginI did a few things in a frontend application to enable the signup and login flow. A step-by-step explanation would take a lot of space here, so I’ll walk you through the most important parts. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter or Linkedin if you have any questions.At the end, the frontend folder structure looked like this:One of the essential things that I changed is the router in the App.tsx file. It has the following code now:In this code:The AppShell component looks like this:CofounderGPT’s explanation:A few notes:The signup process has two steps: a signup form and a confirmation step (a code is sent via email). This flow is defined in the Signup component. Here’s the code for that component:In this code snippet:This code provides a secure signup process for a user, including validation to ensure that the information entered is correct and a second step to verify the user. It also handles errors and some edge cases, like needing to resend the validation code. There’s still some work here to make it production-ready, but it’s good enough to test the GraphQL part.The signup page looks similar to the following screenshot:Once a user enters the data, the app will send a verification code via email and present the following screen:Once the account is verified, a user is automatically logged in. The dashboard still looks the same (the content is hidden because it’s not connected to GraphQL yet):Finally, the log in screen looks like the following screenshot:These pages give us enough to test and connect GraphQL requests, which we’ll do in the next step of the MVP-building process.ScoreboardSince I don’t trust Google to charge my card automatically for ads because I’ve seen them abuse this power many times in Vacation Tracker. I made a pre-payment of $150 CAD and asked it to stick within that prepaid budget.Time spent today: 8hTotal time spent: 145hInvestment today: $0 USDTotal investment: $1,141.54 USDBeta list subscribers: 48Paying customers: 0Revenue: $0What’s nextThe next step is connecting the GraphQL requests and showing the actual data in our app. CofounderGPT will help me to write AppSync resolvers faster and to write React components using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.Like this:RelatedShare:Slobodan StojanovicSlobodan Stojanović is the CTO and co-founder of Vacation Tracker, an application that simplifies employee leave and absence management for organizations.
