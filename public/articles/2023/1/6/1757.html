        <h1>Node v18.13.0 (LTS)</h1>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.13.0">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime, has released its latest long-term support (LTS) version, v18.13.0. This version brings several notable changes and improvements that developers should be aware of.</p>
<p>One of the major changes is the addition of support for externally shared JavaScript (including WASM) dependencies. Previously, Node.js was built so that all dependencies were bundled into the binary itself. However, some distributions prefer to manage dependencies externally. With this update, dependencies with JavaScript code can now be externalized, which will allow other distributions to externalize additional dependencies when needed. This change was contributed by Michael Dawson.</p>
<p>Another addition in this release is the introduction of the File class, which is part of the FileAPI. The File class can be used anywhere a Blob can, for example in URL.createObjectURL and FormData. It contains two properties that Blobs do not have: lastModified, the last time the file was modified in ms, and name, the name of the file. This feature was contributed by Khafra.</p>
<p>Node.js test runner also received an improvement in this release. The node:test module now supports function mocking during testing via a top-level mock object. This allows developers to easily create spies on object methods and assert on the number of calls made. This feature was contributed by Colin Ihrig.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, Node.js v18.13.0 also includes several bug fixes and performance improvements. Developers are encouraged to upgrade to this version to take advantage of these new features and improvements.</p>
<p>To upgrade to the latest version of Node.js, developers can use a package manager like npm or yarn. For example, to upgrade to version 18.13.0 using npm, developers can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g node@18.13.0
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, Node.js v18.13.0 brings several improvements and new features that will benefit developers working with JavaScript and Node.js. As always, it is recommended to keep up with the latest updates and versions to ensure the best performance and security of your applications.</p>
