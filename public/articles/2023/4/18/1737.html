        <h1>Node.js 20.0.0 introduces the Permission Model and other notable changes</h1>
        <div>April 18, 2023 | Topics:  <a href="../../../../categories/node.js">Node.js</a></div>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.0.0">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>Node.js, the popular JavaScript runtime, has released version 20.0.0 (Current) with several new features and improvements. Here are some of the most notable changes:</p>
<p>Permission Model
One of the most significant additions to Node.js is the experimental Permission Model. This feature allows developers to restrict access to specific resources during program execution, such as file system operations, child process spawning, and worker thread creation. By using this feature, developers can prevent their applications from accessing or modifying sensitive data or running potentially harmful code. The API exists behind a flag <code>--experimental-permission</code> which when enabled will restrict access to all available permissions. More information about the Permission Model can be found in the Node.js documentation. This feature was contributed by Rafael Gonzaga in #44004.</p>
<p>Custom ESM loader hooks run on dedicated thread
ESM hooks supplied via loaders (<code>--experimental-loader=foo.mjs</code>) now run in a dedicated thread, isolated from the main thread. This provides a separate scope for loaders and ensures no cross-contamination between loaders and application code.</p>
<p>Synchronous import.meta.resolve()
In alignment with browser behavior, this function now returns synchronously. Despite this, user loader resolve hooks can still be defined as async functions (or as sync functions, if the author prefers). Even when there are async resolve hooks loaded, <code>import.meta.resolve</code> will still return synchronously for application code.</p>
<p>These changes are just a few of the many improvements introduced in Node.js 20.0.0. Developers can check out the full release notes for more information on the latest features and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Node.js continues to be a popular choice for building scalable and efficient server-side applications using JavaScript. With the introduction of the Permission Model and other improvements, Node.js remains a cutting-edge technology that developers should keep an eye on.</p>
