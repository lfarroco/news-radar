        <h1>Node.js 20: New Features and Updates</h1>
        <div>April 18, 2023 | Topics:  <a href="../../../../categories/node.js.html">Node.js</a></div>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>The Node.js Project has recently released Node.js 20, which comes with a number of exciting new features and updates. One of the highlights of this release is the new Node.js Permission Model, which provides developers with an experimental mechanism for restricting access to specific resources.</p>
<p>In addition to the Permission Model, Node.js 20 also introduces a synchronous import.meta.resolve, a stable test_runner, and updates to the V8 JavaScript engine to version 11.3. The release also includes updates to Ada to version 2.0, among other changes.</p>
<p>While the changelog for Node.js 20 only outlines a small subset of the features and work since the last major release, the project continues to make progress across a number of areas. This blog post aims to provide additional context on the larger body of work in relation to those changes.</p>
<p>Release Policy and Download Information</p>
<p>For those interested in learning more about the Node.js release policy, the project has provided more information at <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/release">https://github.com/nodejs/release</a>.

<p>Finally, the updates to the V8 JavaScript engine to version 11.3 and Ada to version 2.0 are also significant changes in this release. These updates provide developers with improved performance and new features, making it easier to build faster and more powerful applications.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Node.js 20 is an exciting release for developers, with a number of new features and updates that can help improve the security, reliability, and performance of their applications. As the project continues to make progress across a number of areas, developers can look forward to even more exciting changes in future releases.</p>
