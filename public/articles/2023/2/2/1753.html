        <h1>Node.js 18.14.0 (LTS) Release Notes</h1>
        <div>February 2, 2023 | Topics:  <a href="../../../../categories/node.js">Node.js</a></div>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.14.0">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>Node.js, the popular JavaScript runtime, has just released its latest LTS version, 18.14.0. This release includes several notable changes, including an update to npm to version 9.3.1. Let&#39;s take a closer look at some of the changes and what they mean for developers.</p>
<p>Updated npm to 9.3.1
The biggest change in this release is the update to npm to version 9.3.1. This update brings several improvements and bug fixes, including better performance and stability. One of the most significant changes is the introduction of a new package-lock.json format, which is designed to be more efficient and reliable than the previous format.</p>
<p>Engines
Another important change in this release is the update to the node engines supported by npm. This change makes it safe to allow npm 9.3.1 as the default in any LTS version of Node.js 14 or 16, as well as anything later than or including 18.0.0. This means that developers can now use the latest version of npm with more recent versions of Node.js without worrying about compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Filesystem
In previous versions of npm, when run as root, the tool attempted to manage file ownership automatically on the user&#39;s behalf. However, this behavior was problematic in many cases and has been removed in favor of allowing users to manage their own filesystem permissions. As a result, npm will no longer attempt to modify ownership of files it creates.</p>
<p>Auth
Finally, any errors thrown from users having unsupported auth configurations will show npm config fix in the remediation instructions, which will allow the user to automatically have their auth config fixed. The presence of auth related settings that are not scoped to a specific package will now result in a warning.</p>
<p>Overall, this release of Node.js and npm includes several important changes that will benefit developers. The update to npm brings better performance and stability, while the changes to the filesystem and auth systems will help to simplify and streamline the development process. As always, developers are encouraged to keep up with the latest releases and updates to ensure that they are using the most efficient and reliable tools available.</p>
