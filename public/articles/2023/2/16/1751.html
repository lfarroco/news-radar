        <h1>Node.js 14.21.3 (LTS) Security Release</h1>
        <div>February 16, 2023 | Topics:  <a href="../../../../categories/node.js">Node.js.html</a></div>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.21.3">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>Node.js has released its latest security update, version 14.21.3 (LTS), which includes fixes for two CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that could potentially allow attackers to bypass permissions policies or perform insecure loading of ICU data. The security update also includes OpenSSL security updates and an npm update to address a number of CVEs.</p>
<p>Developers can find more detailed information about each of the vulnerabilities fixed in this release in the February 2023 Security Releases blog post. It is highly recommended that developers update their Node.js installations to the latest version to ensure the security of their applications.</p>
<p>In addition to the security fixes, this release includes several commits, including an update to npm to version 6.14.18, an upgrade of OpenSSL sources to version 1.1.1t, and a build of ICU with ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE. These updates and upgrades aim to improve the performance and stability of Node.js.</p>
<p>For developers who are interested in the technical details of the commits, they can refer to the commit messages for more information. For example, the commit message for the build of ICU with ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE is:</p>
<p><code>[97a0443f13] - build: build ICU with ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE (RafaelGSS) nodejs-private/node-private#374</code></p>
<p>This commit aims to address a potential security risk by building ICU with the <code>ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE</code> flag, which prevents the override of user data in ICU data files.</p>
<p>Developers who are using Node.js in their projects should always stay up-to-date with the latest security releases to ensure the security and stability of their applications. Node.js provides long-term support (LTS) releases, which are supported for 30 months, as well as current releases, which are supported for 6 months. It is recommended that developers use LTS releases for production environments to ensure stability and security.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Node.js 14.21.3 (LTS) security release includes important security fixes and updates that improve the performance and stability of Node.js. Developers should update their installations to the latest version to ensure the security of their applications.</p>
