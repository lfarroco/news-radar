        </div>
        <p>Node.js has just released version v19.6.1 (Current), which includes several security updates and bug fixes. This release addresses three CVEs, including OpenSSL errors not being cleared in the error stack, experimental policies bypass via process.mainModule.require, and insecure loading of ICU data through ICU_DATA environment variable. </p>
<p>Developers can find more detailed information on each of the vulnerabilities in the February 2023 Security Releases blog post. The release also includes OpenSSL security updates as outlined in the recent OpenSSL security advisory and undici security update.</p>
<p>In addition to the security updates, this release includes several commits, including updates to dependencies and build processes. The ICU library is now built with ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE, and OpenSSL errors are now cleared on invalid CA certificates. Undici, a Node.js HTTP client, has also been updated to version 5.19.1.</p>
<p>For developers using experimental policies, a patch has been added to makeRequireFunction to prevent bypassing of these policies. </p>
<p>To upgrade to the latest version, developers can use the Node Version Manager (nvm) or download the latest version from the Node.js website. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of how to use nvm to upgrade to the latest version:</p>
<pre><code>nvm install v19.6.1
nvm use v19.6.1
</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s important for developers to keep their Node.js installations up to date to ensure they have the latest security updates and bug fixes. By staying current with the latest releases, developers can ensure their applications are secure and performant. </p>
<p>Overall, Node.js v19.6.1 (Current) is a security release that addresses several vulnerabilities and includes updates to dependencies and build processes. Developers can upgrade to the latest version using nvm or downloading from the Node.js website.</p>
