<p>PhpStorm&#39;s Favorite Coding Tracks
The JetBrains PhpStorm team reached out to 20 members of the PHP community and asked them to name their favorite coding tracks. The result is a playlist tailor-made for PHP developers. Check out the playlist and see if your favorite tracks made the list.</p>
<p>PHP 8.1 Alpha Released
PHP 8.1 Alpha has been released, and it comes with a host of new features and improvements. Among the changes are the addition of the Fibers feature, which allows developers to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style. The new release also includes the new <code>str_contains()</code> function, which makes it easier to check if a string contains a specific substring. PHP 8.1 Alpha also comes with a host of performance improvements, making it faster and more efficient than ever before.</p>
<p>Laravel 9 in the Works
Laravel, one of the most popular PHP frameworks, is currently working on version 9. The new release promises to bring a host of new features and improvements, including support for PHP 8.1, better performance, and improved error handling. Laravel 9 is expected to be released later this year.</p>

The new release comes with a host of new features and improvements, including support for PHP 8.1, improved performance, and better error handling. Symfony 6 also includes a new component called HttpClient, which makes it easier to make HTTP requests in your PHP applications.</p>
