        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://smashingmagazine.com/2023/06/penpot-flex-layout-building-css-layouts-design-tool/">here</a>.

        <p>Penpot is an open-source design tool that aims to improve collaboration between designers and developers. It is based on open web standards and is the first fully open-source design tool. Penpot&#39;s approach can help to improve design to development processes and make them seamless and faster. </p>
<p>One of Penpot&#39;s standout features is its Flex Layout, which allows designers to build CSS layouts directly in the design tool. This feature brings parity between design and code and follows the same rules as CSS. The Flex Layout feature has been improved since its initial release, making it even better for creating layouts. </p>
<p>Penpot&#39;s Flex Layout is built on top of CSS Flexbox, which is a powerful layout system that allows for flexible and responsive layouts. Flexbox is widely used in web development, and Penpot&#39;s integration of it makes it easy for designers to create layouts that can be easily translated into code. </p>
<p>Developers can benefit from Penpot&#39;s Flex Layout by being able to easily extract the CSS code from the design tool. This can save time and effort in the development process, as developers can quickly get the CSS code they need to implement the design. </p>
<p>Overall, Penpot&#39;s Flex Layout is a valuable tool for designers and developers looking to improve collaboration and streamline their workflow. Its use of open web standards and integration with CSS Flexbox make it a powerful tool for creating flexible and responsive layouts.</p>
