    <div class="disclaimer">
    This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://board.asm32.info/asmbb-v3-0-has-been-released.401/">here</a>.
    </div>
    <p>AsmBB v3.0 has recently been released, bringing with it new features and improved security. This fast and lightweight web forum engine is fully written in assembly language and uses SQLite as its database back-end. As a result, it can work on weak hosting and serve a large number of visitors without any lags or delays.</p>
<p>One of the key features of AsmBB is its security. Its internal design and reduced dependencies make it a very secure web application. In addition, AsmBB supports encrypted databases for even higher security. The new version 3.0 comes with a new encryption library, making it even more secure than before.</p>
<p>AsmBB has very few requirements for the running environment, making it easy to set up and use. It only requires an x86 Linux server, no matter if it&#39;s 32 or 64 bit. There is no need to have any specially preinstalled libraries. The smallest/cheapest VPS is fine, and shared hosting is also suitable if it supports FastCGI. AsmBB has been tested with Nginx, Apache, Lighttpd, Hiawatha, and RWASA.</p>
<p>AsmBB is easy to customize and modify, thanks to its powerful template system. This allows for easy customization of the forum without actually modifying the code, which is a great advantage for developers who want to create a unique forum experience for their users.</p>
<p>One of the major improvements in AsmBB v3.0 is the reduction of bugs. The new version has less bugs than the previous one, making it more stable and reliable. This is a great advantage for developers who want to use AsmBB for their forum projects.</p>
<p>In addition, AsmBB v3.0 comes with new features that make it even more user-friendly. For example, it now has a new notification system that allows users to receive notifications when they receive new messages or replies. This feature is very useful for forum users who want to stay up-to-date with the latest discussions.</p>
<p>AsmBB v3.0 is a great choice for developers who want to create a fast and secure web forum engine. Its use of assembly language and SQLite make it a unique and powerful tool for building forums. With its new features and improved security, AsmBB v3.0 is a great choice for developers who want to keep up with the latest trends in the industry. </p>
