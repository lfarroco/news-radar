    <h1>Why Small Commits or Feature Commits are Better for Code Development</h1>
    <div class="disclaimer">
    This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://numla.com/blog/miscellaneous-17/small-commits-feature-commits-better-code-development-26">here</a>.

    <p>In the world of software development, following good coding practices is essential to ensure code quality, maintainability, and collaboration. One such practice is making small, feature-based commits instead of large, sweeping changes. In this article, we&#39;ll explore why feature commits are better than large commits, and how they can help improve your development workflow.</p>
<p>The Advantages of Small Commits in Code Development</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the benefits that come with adopting a small commit approach in your development process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Better Code Quality</li>
</ol>
<p>Small, feature-based commits allow developers to focus on a single feature or bug fix at a time, rather than trying to tackle multiple changes in a single commit. This approach leads to cleaner, more modular code that is easier to understand and maintain.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Easier to Review</li>
</ol>
<p>When you make small commits, it&#39;s easier for your team members to review your code changes. They can quickly understand what changes you made and why you made them. This makes the review process faster and more efficient.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Easier to Collaborate</li>
</ol>
<p>Small commits make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase without stepping on each other&#39;s toes. Each developer can work on their own feature or bug fix, and then merge their changes into the main codebase without causing conflicts.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Easier to Debug</li>
</ol>
<p>When you make small commits, it&#39;s easier to track down bugs and issues in your code. You can isolate the changes that caused the problem and quickly roll back those changes if necessary. This makes debugging faster and more efficient.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Better for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</li>
</ol>
<p>Small commits are better for CI/CD because they allow you to test and deploy changes more frequently. With large commits, you may have to wait longer to test and deploy your changes, which can slow down your development process.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, adopting a small commit approach in your development process can lead to better code quality, easier code reviews and collaboration, faster debugging, and a more efficient CI/CD process. So, the next time you&#39;re working on a feature or bug fix, consider making small, feature-based commits instead of large, sweeping changes. Your team members (and your future self) will thank you.</p>
