    <h1>Overcoming Roadblocks in Developing Letlang: A Programming Language Targeting Rust</h1>
    <div class="disclaimer">
    This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://david-delassus.medium.com/letlang-roadblocks-and-how-to-overcome-them-38cc46c8432">here</a>.

    <p>This article was originally published on the Link Society website and written by David Delassus, CEO and Co-Founder. In this article, he discusses the challenges he faced while developing his programming language, Letlang, and how he overcame them.</p>
<p>Delassus begins by stating that he has been working on Letlang for some time now and has made significant progress in designing the runtime and features. However, he also acknowledges that there were roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges he faced was integrating Letlang with Rust, a popular systems programming language. He found that the syntax and semantics of Rust were quite different from Letlang, which made integration difficult. To overcome this, he spent time studying Rust&#39;s syntax and semantics and made changes to Letlang&#39;s design to make it more compatible with Rust.</p>
<p>Another challenge he faced was implementing garbage collection in Letlang. He found that traditional garbage collection algorithms were not suitable for his language&#39;s design and had to come up with a new algorithm that would work. He eventually settled on a reference counting algorithm that was more efficient and better suited to Letlang&#39;s design.</p>
<p>Delassus also discusses how he overcame other roadblocks, such as implementing a parser and dealing with errors in Letlang&#39;s code. He provides code snippets and examples to illustrate his solutions, making it easier for developers to understand and apply them to their own projects.</p>
<p>In conclusion, developing a programming language is a challenging task, and roadblocks are inevitable. However, with perseverance and a willingness to learn and adapt, these roadblocks can be overcome. Delassus&#39;s experience in developing Letlang provides valuable insights for developers who are working on their own programming languages or facing similar challenges in their projects.</p>
