        <h1>Visual Studio Code May 2023 Release Notes</h1>
        <div>June 7, 2023 | Topics:  </div>
        <div class="disclaimer">

        </div>
        <p>The May 2023 release of Visual Studio Code (version 1.79) is now available for download. This release comes with new features and fixes that are aimed at improving the coding experience for developers.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of this release is the addition of new accessibility.verbosity settings. These settings have been added to inform screen reader users how to interact with features when they are focused. For instance, GitHub Copilot now has hints that describe how to access the accessible help menus for the Copilot chat view and in-editor code chat. These help menus provide information about what to expect, how to navigate from the input box to other elements, and more.</p>
<p>Other new verbosity settings provide information for specific VS Code UI, and they are enabled by default. However, developers can silence them individually if they choose to.</p>
<p>In addition to the accessibility improvements, VoiceOver on macOS now reads the descriptions of enum setting options in the Settings editor. This feature can be tried out with enum settings such as files.autoSave.</p>
<p>The May 2023 release of Visual Studio Code also comes with other notable features and improvements. Here are some of them:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Improved debugging experience
This release comes with improved debugging features that make it easier for developers to debug their code. For instance, there is now a new &quot;Debug with Environment&quot; option that allows developers to launch a debug session with a specific environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New Git features
Visual Studio Code now has new Git features that make it easier for developers to work with Git repositories. For instance, there is now a new &quot;Git: Checkout&quot; command that allows developers to switch between Git branches quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improved terminal experience
This release also comes with improvements to the integrated terminal. For instance, there is now a new &quot;Terminal: Clear&quot; command that allows developers to clear the terminal quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New extension recommendations
Visual Studio Code now recommends extensions that are relevant to the current workspace. This feature can be accessed by clicking on the &quot;Recommendations&quot; button in the Extensions view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other improvements
Other improvements in this release include better support for TypeScript 4.5, improved code navigation, and better support for remote development.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, the May 2023 release of Visual Studio Code comes with several new features and improvements that are aimed at improving the coding experience for developers. The addition of new accessibility.verbosity settings is particularly noteworthy, as it shows the commitment of the VS Code team to making the editor more accessible to everyone. Developers are encouraged to download and try out this latest release.</p>
