        <h1>Introducing the Rust Leadership Council</h1>
        <div>June 19, 2023 | Topics:  <a href="../../../../categories/ruby.html">Ruby</a></div>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/20/introducing-leadership-council.html">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>The Rust Project has recently formed a new top-level governance body called the Leadership Council, as RFC 3392 has been merged. This Council will be responsible for top-level governance concerns, while the nine top-level teams will handle most of the Rust Project&#39;s responsibilities, such as maintenance of the compiler and core tooling, evolution of the language and standard libraries, administration of infrastructure, and more.</p>
<p>The Council is composed of representatives from each of the top-level teams, as defined in the RFC. The Core Team and interim Leadership Chat have been thanked for their hard work over the years, but the governance of the Rust Project has had its shortcomings. The new Council aims to build on the successes and improve upon the failures, ultimately leading to greater transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>The Rust Leadership Council is a significant development for the Rust community, as it will provide a central body to oversee the project&#39;s governance and ensure that it continues to evolve in a positive direction. This will be especially important as Rust continues to gain popularity among developers and becomes an increasingly important language in the industry.</p>
<p>For developers who are interested in Rust, this news is particularly relevant, as it signals that the language is continuing to grow and mature. It also highlights the importance of community involvement in the development of programming languages and frameworks. As Rust continues to evolve, developers will be able to rely on the Leadership Council to ensure that the language remains stable, secure, and up-to-date.</p>
<p>To get started with Rust, developers can visit the official Rust website, where they can download the latest version of the language and find a wealth of resources to help them get started. The Rust community is also very active, with many forums, mailing lists, and chat rooms available for developers to connect with one another and share their experiences.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple Rust program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This program prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console when run. Rust is known for its emphasis on safety and performance, making it a popular choice for systems programming, web development, and other applications.</p>
<p>Overall, the formation of the Rust Leadership Council is a positive development for the Rust community and for developers who are interested in the language. It demonstrates the commitment of the Rust Project to continue evolving and improving, and provides a central body to oversee the project&#39;s governance and ensure that it remains a top choice for developers.</p>
