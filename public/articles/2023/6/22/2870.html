        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://claudioholanda.ch/en/blog/svelte-kit-after-3-billion-requests/">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>SvelteKit, a framework for building web applications, has gained popularity in the past year. In this article, we will explore why one developer chose SvelteKit for a news website project, and the good and bad aspects of working with the framework.</p>
<p>The Project
The developer&#39;s company was tasked with building a news website from scratch, with a custom CMS and decoupled backend. SvelteKit was proposed due to its malleability and scalability needs, and the tight schedule of the project. In the past year, the website has handled approximately 3 billion requests, with significant audience growth.</p>
<p>The Good and Bad
SvelteKit&#39;s ease of use and performance were highlighted as positives. The framework&#39;s syntax and component-based approach allowed for quick development and easy maintenance. However, the lack of documentation and community support were noted as drawbacks. The developer also encountered issues with server-side rendering and deployment.</p>
<p>Conclusion
Despite the challenges faced, the developer remains satisfied with their choice of SvelteKit for the news website project. The framework&#39;s performance and ease of use outweighed the drawbacks, and the project&#39;s success is a testament to its capabilities. For developers looking to try out SvelteKit, it is important to keep in mind the potential challenges and limitations, but also the benefits it can bring to web application development.</p>
