        <h1>Writing a Toy JVM in Rust</h1>
        <div>July 13, 2023 | Topics:  <a href="../../../../categories/java.html">Java</a>, <a href="../../../../categories/rust.html">Rust</a></div>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://andreabergia.com/blog/2023/07/i-have-written-a-jvm-in-rust/">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>In this article, the author shares their experience of writing a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in Rust. The project, named &quot;rjvm,&quot; is a toy JVM built for learning purposes rather than a serious implementation. The code for the project is available on GitHub.</p>
<p>While the author acknowledges that the toy JVM does not support certain features, they have implemented several non-trivial functionalities. For example, the toy JVM uses the real rt.jar containing classes from the OpenJDK 7, allowing it to execute Java code using actual JDK classes.</p>
<p>The author expresses their satisfaction with what they have learned about Rust and implementing a virtual machine. They highlight the successful implementation of a garbage collector, which, although mediocre, is a personal achievement.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the author plans to provide a high-level overview of how their JVM works in this article. They also mention the possibility of writing more detailed articles about specific aspects of the implementation in the future.</p>
<p>Code organization:
The code for the toy JVM is organized into three crates (packages) within a standard Rust project. The author is considering extracting the reader crate into a separate repository and publishing it on crates.io, as it could be useful to others.</p>
<p>Parsing a .class file:
To execute Java code, the JVM first loads a .class file containing the bytecode generated by the javac compiler. The author has created a separate crate named &quot;reader&quot; to parse the class file and return a Rust struct that models a class and its contents.</p>
<p>Executing methods:
The main API of the toy JVM is Vm::invoke, which is used to execute a method. It takes a CallStack, containing CallFrames for each method being executed. Each function invocation adds a new frame to the call stack. When a method&#39;s execution completes, its frame is dropped and removed from the call stack.</p>
<p>The toy JVM supports executing both Java methods and native methods. Native methods are implemented directly by the JVM and not in Java bytecode. They are commonly used for low-level interactions with the operating system or runtime support.</p>
<p>Overall, this article provides insights into the process of building a toy JVM in Rust and highlights the author&#39;s learnings and achievements. Developers interested in JVM internals and Rust programming may find this project and its future articles valuable resources.</p>
