        <p>The Rust programming language has announced the release of its 1.70.0 pre-release version, which is now available for testing. The official release is scheduled for June 1st, 2023. Developers can find the release notes on the Rust website.</p>
<p>To try out the pre-release version locally, developers can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain=1.70.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>The pre-release version can also be accessed through the index at <code>https://dev-static.rust-lang.org/dist/2023-05-29/index.html</code>.</p>
<p>Developers are encouraged to provide feedback on the pre-release version through the Rust internals thread. Additionally, the release team is considering changes to the pre-release process and welcomes feedback on the related GitHub issue.</p>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, speed, and concurrency. It is designed to prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows. Rust has gained popularity in recent years due to its performance and safety features, making it a popular choice for systems programming.</p>
<p>The 1.70.0 pre-release version includes several new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>std::task</code> module has been stabilized, providing a foundation for Rust&#39;s async/await story.</li>
<li>The <code>#[must_use]</code> attribute has been added to the standard library, allowing developers to annotate functions and methods that should not be ignored.</li>
<li>The <code>#[track_caller]</code> attribute has been stabilized, allowing developers to get more information about the call stack when debugging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers can also look forward to improvements in the Rust compiler, including better error messages and improved performance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Rust 1.70.0 pre-release version is now available for testing, with the official release scheduled for June 1st, 2023. Developers can try out the pre-release version locally and provide feedback to the Rust team. With new features and improvements, Rust continues to be a popular choice for systems programming due to its safety and performance features.</p>
