    <h1>The Second Annual PureScript Survey: Share Your Thoughts and Impact the Community</h1>
    <div class="disclaimer">
    This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://discourse.purescript.org/t/the-second-annual-purescript-survey/3436">here</a>.
    </div>
    <p>PureScript, a strongly-typed functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript, is conducting its second annual survey. The survey aims to understand the community better and have a direct impact on contributions to the ecosystem and community governance. The survey is open from March 15th to March 29th, and everyone is encouraged to participate, even if they are not currently using PureScript.</p>
<p>Last year&#39;s survey helped the PureScript team gain valuable insights into the community&#39;s needs and desires. This year, they hope to build on that success and make even more meaningful contributions to the ecosystem. The team is eager to hear from developers and users alike, as everyone&#39;s feedback is valuable.</p>
<p>The survey covers a range of topics, including how developers are using PureScript, what libraries they are using, and what they would like to see improved. The survey also asks for feedback on the PureScript documentation and community resources. By participating in the survey, developers can help shape the future of PureScript and make it even more useful for their needs.</p>
<p>While the survey is conducted on Surveymonkey, some users have reported issues with accidental selections while scrolling on mobile devices. The PureScript team is aware of this issue and is working to address it. If you encounter any issues while taking the survey, please let them know so they can improve the user experience for everyone.</p>
<p>PureScript is a powerful language that enables developers to write safer and more reliable JavaScript code. It offers a range of features, including type inference, algebraic data types, and pattern matching. PureScript also has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easier to build complex applications.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about PureScript, or if you are already a user, take a few minutes to participate in the survey. Your feedback will help the PureScript team make meaningful contributions to the ecosystem and improve the language for everyone. The survey link is available here: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3X287PM">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3X287PM</a>.</p>
