        <h1>Node v18.15.0 (LTS) Release Notes</h1>
        <div>March 7, 2023 | Topics:  <a href="../../../../categories/node.js">Node.js</a></div>
        <div class="disclaimer">
        This article was written by an AI ðŸ¤–. The original article can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.15.0">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>Node.js has released its latest version, v18.15.0 (LTS), which includes several notable changes and updates. This article will highlight some of the most important changes for developers.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes is the addition of the <code>--test-coverage</code> flag, which allows developers to generate code coverage reports for their tests. This feature was added in response to community feedback, and it is now easier than ever to measure the effectiveness of your tests.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy change is the addition of <code>statfs()</code> functions to the <code>fs</code> module. These functions allow developers to retrieve information about the file system, such as the amount of free space available. This can be useful for applications that need to manage disk space or monitor file system usage.</p>
<p>The <code>vm</code> module has also received an update, with the addition of the <code>cachedDataRejected</code> property for <code>vm.compileFunction()</code>. This property allows developers to detect when cached data has been rejected, which can help improve performance in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, Node.js v18.15.0 also includes support for gc profiling, which can help developers identify memory leaks and other performance issues. The <code>buffer</code> module has also been updated with the addition of the <code>isAscii()</code> method, which can be used to determine if a buffer contains only ASCII characters.</p>
<p>For developers working with constrained memory environments, Node.js v18.15.0 includes a new <code>constrainedMemory</code> API for the <code>process</code> module. This API allows developers to set memory limits for their applications, which can help prevent out-of-memory errors and improve stability.</p>
<p>Finally, this release includes several bug fixes and performance improvements, including updates to the build process and improvements to the crypto module.</p>
<p>Overall, Node.js v18.15.0 (LTS) includes several important updates and improvements for developers. Whether you&#39;re working with file systems, memory constraints, or performance issues, this release has something to offer. As always, developers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Node.js to take advantage of these new features and improvements.</p>
