<li>c-ares, a C library for asynchronous DNS requests, has been updated to version 1.19.0.</li>
<li>npm, Node.js&#39; package manager, has been upgraded to version 8.19.4.</li>
<li>Corepack, a tool for managing Node.js dependencies, has been updated to version 0.17.0.</li>
<li>Support for externally shared JavaScript built-ins has been added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code Changes
Several commits have been made to Node.js&#39; codebase, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for a hang when no algorithm is available in the crypto module.</li>
<li>Ensuring authentication tag is set for chacha20-poly1305 in the crypto module.</li>
<li>Cherry-picking updates to V8, Node.js&#39; JavaScript engine.</li>
<li>Updates to dependencies such as undici, c-ares, npm, and corepack.</li>
</ul>

For example, the update to undici can improve the efficiency of HTTP/1.1 requests, while the update to c-ares can improve the speed of DNS requests. The upgrade to npm can provide access to new features and bug fixes, while the update to corepack can improve the management of dependencies.</p>
<p>Node.js is a popular choice for building scalable and high-performance applications, particularly in server-side web development. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model allows for efficient handling of multiple requests simultaneously. Node.js also has a large and active community, with many libraries and frameworks available to simplify development.</p>
<p>Developers can install Node.js v16.20.0 (LTS) using a package manager such as npm or yarn. They can also download pre-built binaries from the Node.js website. Once installed, developers can use Node.js to run JavaScript code on the server-side, build command-line tools, and more.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Node.js v16.20.0 (LTS) includes several notable changes and updates to dependencies, providing developers with improved performance and security for their applications. Node.js remains a popular choice for server-side web development, with a large and active community supporting its development.</p>
