    <p>We are excited to share the news of the preview release of C# Dev Kit, a new Visual Studio Code extension that offers an improved editor-first C# development experience for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Originally published on the Microsoft Developer blog, this extension is designed to enhance your productivity when working in VS Code.</p>
<p>The C# Dev Kit works in conjunction with the C# extension, which has been updated to be powered by a new fully open-source Language Server Protocol (LSP) host. This creates a performant, extensible, and flexible tooling environment that easily integrates new experiences into C# for VS Code. The source repository for this extension is in the process of being migrated and will be available later this week.</p>
<p>C# Dev Kit borrows familiar concepts from Visual Studio to bring a more productive and reliable C# experience to VS Code. It consists of a set of VS Code extensions that work together to provide a rich C# editing experience, AI-powered development, solution management, and integrated testing. The C# Dev Kit includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The C# extension, which provides base language services support and syntax highlighting.</li>
<li>The C# editor, which offers a more productive and reliable editing experience with features such as IntelliSense, code navigation, and refactoring.</li>
<li>The C# project system, which provides a solution explorer and project management capabilities.</li>
<li>The C# debugger, which enables debugging of C# applications within VS Code.</li>
<li>The C# test explorer, which provides integrated testing capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the C# Dev Kit, you can develop C# web and cloud-native projects with ease. The extension offers a range of features that help you write better code faster, including code completion, error detection, and code navigation. Additionally, the AI-powered development feature provides intelligent suggestions and recommendations to improve your coding experience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the C# Dev Kit is a powerful extension that offers a range of features to enhance your C# development experience in VS Code. We encourage you to try it out for your next project and share your feedback with the community. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting new development tool!</p>
